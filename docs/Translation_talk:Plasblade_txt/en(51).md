Why is the damage Normal? I would like to change it to Plasma...

Something about striking at armor joining points here?

Err... one-use? It's infinite-uses, isn't it?

Yes, one use (as described very detailed in the text). Either thrown or
applied directly. Please consult your weapon engineer or scientist about
possible adverse reactions. :) --[Hoehrer](User:Hoehrer "wikilink")

Wait, but... I can use a single one as many times as I want, to my
experience. I once went after an Ortnok and used a single plasma blade 3
times in a row to kill it. o_O

Depends on the version of the game you are playing. The Plasma-Blade
underwent quite a bit of change (code-wise) since e.g. and of the 2.1
releases. If this happens to you in most recent code (e.g. development
version of SVN trunk or the new 2.2 branch) please file a
[bug-report](https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=157793&atid=805242).
I re-checked the behaviour in SVN trunk yesterday just in case though
(and it worked as described here), so I believe you are using an older
version? :) Also the 3d-model of the blade does not have any visible
"blade" part anymore - it's basically only the handle now.
