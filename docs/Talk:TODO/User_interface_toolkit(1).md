Minor suggestion: Options menu reordering

Currently:

Input Video Sound Game

I suggest this order:

Game Video Sound Input

It seems more logical to me, and happens to more closely follow the
order in other games.

i see no problem with the reordering. it's just some pos parameter for
the button nodes in the base/ufos/menu_options.ufo. patches are welcome.
we are currently all working on other menus - so it might take some time
until we get to it (the best would be to submit a patch).

Done and patched. That was easy :) --[Volatar](User:Volatar "wikilink")
