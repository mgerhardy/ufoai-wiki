On the subject of items not showing on the floor while actually being
there, I've encountered some variations, although behavior is mostly as
described by Zenerka:

- In one case, the dropped item (a smoke grenade) showed correctly while
  the rest of the container remained invisible.
- In one case, dropping an item made the invisible item (a grenade
  launcher) visible. I could then pick up the grenade launcher, but it
  was not (visually) removed from the inventory.

## Pascal for EV_INV_ADD

Do we have to use pascal string for EV_INV_ADD? Can't we send amount of
items first and then just items in proper
loops?--[Zenerka](User:Zenerka "wikilink") 01:13, 23 April 2007 (CEST)
