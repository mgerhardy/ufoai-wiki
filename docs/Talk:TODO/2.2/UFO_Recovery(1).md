a storyline suggestion to explain what happens to antimatter when a UFO
crashes or is shot down, this might explain the absence of a large bang
and the irretrievability of antimatter from crashed UFOs:

The antimatter containment goes into safe mode, to prevent mass
annihilation during the crash. It cannot be retreived.

The containment might even let the odd antiparticle out. Letting the
antimatter safely leak away over millenia.
