instead of using *color: 0.5 0.5 0.5;* we should use *color "0.5 0.5
0.5"* even if this is no css - i don't see the point in adding another
parsing and syntax style - but i like the idea of templates or style
classes.


Every time i do something, i look at existing ones. CSS provide some
selectors we can use in the future what why i write that. But for the
moment it can be "too much". If you are interested by style, i can use
the current parser, something very simple like

<!-- -->

    style mainButton
    {
        size "256 64"
        image "menu/button_big"
        font "f_menubig"
        color "0 0.5 0 1"
        selectcolor "1 1 1 1"
    }
