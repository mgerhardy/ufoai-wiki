What if we will use XPath-like syntax for work with nodes?

It was my first idea, but the syntax and the semantic is a little
complex (element list, property filter...) then creating a real
implementation is not easy. And i dont think a subset of the language
will be more easy (to implement or to read). Anyway feel free to write
something about that (on that page if you want, with some examples), it
can be usefull for the future, because i prefered using know thing than
creating new things. [Bayo](User:Bayo "wikilink") 19:56, 27 July 2010
