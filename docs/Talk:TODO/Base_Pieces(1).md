I have few things on my mind about the apperance of some base tiles.
Would this Talk be the good place to point them
out?--[Zenerka](User:Zenerka "wikilink") 17:59, 7 August 2007 (CEST)

- Good question. Regardless, fact is that I commented on the hospital
  image outside the scope of this page.

  - I will start to pointing things out here. If this will be wrong
    place, please just move that somewhere else. And storyliners, please
    respond to that, i want to trigger the discussion to make sure that
    the base maps will go FINAL and will be comply with wikipedia
    articles--[Zenerka](User:Zenerka "wikilink") 18:32, 7 August 2007

- Alien Containment Facility (all quotes from wikipedia article)
  - Problems:
    - "Firstly, the airtight habitation chambers provide a place to
      store and keep extraterrestrials" - the map does not have any
      chambers
    - "The facility also has a fully-equipped cryo-morgue to store
      corpses and samples for later review." - I do not see anything on
      the map which would fit such description
    - "If a PHALANX base were to be attacked, immediate consideration
      should be given to hit the panic button on the entire Containment
      Facility."
    - according to our scripts, single Alien Containment should be
      capable to store 10 alive aliens
  - Proposed solution by Zenerka:
    - Alien Containment facility map should have two levels
    - the downstairs level should contains only entrances, stairs to
      second level and the one main room; this room should contain 10
      "habitation chambers" with "waldo-operated medical and
      interrogation apparatus" - I don't know whether we can fit 10
      chambers into single map tile; if not, I would suggest to reduce
      the amount to some other value; in any case the map should indeed
      show how many alive aliens we can store
    - the upper level should contain two rooms
      - first room is the operation centre with computers, desks and
        chairs - this would be the place with "the big red button", the
        place where operators can direct the "waldo-operated medical and
        interrogation apparatus", which is "present in each habitation
        chamber, able to apply sedation, medication or other chemical
        injections via a pneumatic dart launcher, or to administer
        electroshocks for interrogation purposes"
      - second room would be the storage of "fully-equipped cryo-morgue
        to store corpses"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Given Zenerka's comments above and Winter's writeup, I have come to
  the conclusion that the AC facility just isn't going to work on a
  single tile, especially given "The chambers and corridors of the
  Containment Facility are specially designed to allow EXTs of any shape
  and size to be transported and held. The facility also has a
  fully-equipped cryo-morgue to store corpses and samples for later
  review". I have made a first sketch of the lower floor of a
  double-size AC (I was lazy so I didn't draw all the difficult things),
  uploaded to this wiki:![](AC_Sketch.jpg "AC_Sketch.jpg")


Zenerka, what do you think?


I like it; I also was considering the idea of making this facility
double-tile; nice work with the lower floor for
me--[Zenerka](User:Zenerka "wikilink") 19:38, 7 August 2007 (CEST)

- And here is a sketch for the other floor. However, given the nature of
  the facilities on this floor (cryo-morgue and control room), I would
  much prefer this to be in the basement rather than on the upper level.
  I decided to make a room for autopsies on this sketch on the basis
  that we shouldn't be able to store alien corpses without an AC in the
  first place, so we shouldn't be able to do autopsy research without
  one anyway. Also, while the sketches indicate stairs, we should
  consider turning them into elevators later. Large alien bodies need to
  be carted to the morgue, and I doubt the workers are going to break
  their backs trying to get them down the stairs.

  - Two conclusions:
    - you think it would be better to make the cryo+control downstairs
      and chambers upstairs, or did I get you wrong? After some thinking
      I like that idea better than "my original" one
      - Yes, that's right. But the chambers should still be level with
        the base's main floor, so cryo+control would be all the way at
        the bottom. --[BTAxis](User:BTAxis "wikilink") 19:06, 8 August

        - I don't think we can place anything under current "base main
          floor". It would need rearrangement of every other base tile
          (not worth of it IMO)--[Zenerka](User:Zenerka "wikilink")
          19:59, 8 August 2007 (CEST)
          - Hm? No, it wouldn't. Existing facilities already do use the
            space underneath the floor. The living quarters has the
            bunker entrance there, and the hangars have slots there for
            the lifts. Also take a look at the rocket facility. It also
            uses the basement space. --[BTAxis](User:BTAxis "wikilink")

    - okay, so if Winter has no objections, I would suggest to place
      your mockups (and update them if they need) and explanation on the
      TODO/2.2/ page under maps section and I will kindly ask mattn for
      creating new AC map ;-\>--[Zenerka](User:Zenerka "wikilink")

    - research topics for alien autopsies should be blocked without
      having Alien Containment, right? That is already the case, I
      believe--[Zenerka](User:Zenerka "wikilink") 14:06, 8 August 2007
