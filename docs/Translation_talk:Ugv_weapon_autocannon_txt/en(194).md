Should the round size be 12.7 mm instead of just 12 mm? That way it
matches up with 0.5 inches, and .50 caliber seems to be a standard size
for mounted machine guns. [Psawhn](User:Psawhn "wikilink") 20:15, 22

Also 12 mm sounds more like heavy machine-gun, rather than autocannon.
Though not sure how that work with gatlings.
