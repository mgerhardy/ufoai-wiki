afaik there are mediawiki plugins/scripts/whatever to detect the users
system specs to offer the correct download - e.g. like here:
<http://www.teeworlds.com/> . would be nice to have that, that a user is
directed to the windows download of ufo if he's using a windows machine.


I can check extension, but it is easy to do with JavaScript.

Well, we only can know it come from windows/linux/unix/mac, we can't
know ubuntu/debian... [Bayo](User:Bayo "wikilink") 12:18, 4 May 2010
