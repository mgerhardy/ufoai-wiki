------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Overview

This drum contains 100 rounds of 4.7x33mm caseless ammunition,
armour-piercing mod. Unlike rifle magazines, the rounds in this drum are
linked together into a long belt rather than stacked onto a spring. The
belt links are made of a special plastic that disintegrates upon
exposure to open air.

The rounds themselves are tungsten-cored steel penetrators, encased in
their own propellant rather than heavy brass casings. They perform well
against a variety of enemies at short and medium ranges.

The magazine is meant to be loaded into an MG12 Machine Gun.

### Recommended Doctrine

All soldiers equipped with machine guns should carry at least one reload
whenever they go out in the field. It is not advisable to send our
troops into combat without spare magazines.

### Addenda

None.
