## Main Page Formatting

In the wiki formatting script for this page I've changed 5px to 20px and
now it looks much better on my screen. I guess this is because I have
1600x1200 and px are points, so the separation was not visible on my
screen. Is there a way to specify the distance between the columns in
centimeters (or even better in fonts, since DPI is often fake) instead
of pixels (like 1.5ex or 1.5em in LaTex)? Now I've made it 2% (seems to
be not pixel-based) and its nice on my screen. How is it with your
screens/browsers? --[Bandobras](user:Bandobras "wikilink")

I think the percentage-setting is fine.

## Help Pages about Wiki Formatting

BTW, where is any documentation on this wiki formatting language (both
Help in the navigation menu and Editing help in the editing mode are
void)? Now I've found some on the net. For now I would put a link to
<http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Contents> in those two places. Good
idea? --[Bandobras](user:Bandobras "wikilink")

The formatting language is plain HTML/CSS (embessed into the
wiki-syntax). Just search for it :) --[Hoehrer](User:Hoehrer "wikilink")

Well, the "embedded" part is the problem. I've heard no objections so
I've included the link to the wikimedia help pages at our two main help
pages. --[Bandobras](User:Bandobras "wikilink") 18:21, 12 June 2006

## Organization of the Wikipedia

I think it would be helpful to add a section describing the various
releases of UFOAI. Specifically, features of each TechDemo as they come
out. --[Agslinda](User:Agslinda "wikilink")

That's what the [Changelog](Changelog "wikilink") (and
[TODO](TODO "wikilink")) page is for ;) The previous versions (before
0.12) are not yet included in the changelog, but this is of no priority
right now. If you find missing features/bugfixes in the entries of older
versions, feel free to add them. --[Hoehrer](User:Hoehrer "wikilink")

## Image functions

It would seem the "thumb" and "\[N\]px" options are unavailable. I
intend to add images to the wiki, so I'm probably going to need resizing
at least \[EDIT: This sounds arrogant, I meant "I would quite like
resizing"\], thumbnails would be nice.

Thumbnails should work now. See the [Sandbox](Sandbox "wikilink") for an
example. --[Hoehrer](User:Hoehrer "wikilink") 13:17, 1 December 2006

Hmm is there a max image size limit?

Arrg, I uploaded PNGs of all the base facilities (Converted from the
TGAs), but they're quite big (filesize). So I started uploading JPGs,
but one of them is half size one full size, and the replace function
didn't work.
Can a nice admin delete the files: "Intercept.jpg" and "Ufo-hangar.jpg",
there also appears to be a limit of around 150kb on images (which is
fair enough), this is why there is no PNG of the "Dropship hangar".

The two mentiooned files have been deleted.
--[Hoehrer](User:Hoehrer "wikilink") 13:17, 1 December 2006 (CET)

Finally if there's a really bored admin, they can finish uploading JPGs
and replacing the PNGs on the Base Facilities/ articles.

## Main page

The bugs link looks a little out of place, all the other links are
yellow, and it's white with one word yellow.
Also shouldn't it read "What to do." or "What should I do?"

Better now? --[Hoehrer](User:Hoehrer "wikilink") 13:05, 1 December 2006

## Screenshots? Where?

It seems that this wiki is missing a screenshots section and so it isn't
possible to check out game footage or even unit/equipment pictures. That
sucks a bit.

You ever visited the [homepage](http://ufo.ninex.info/)? :) Check/browse
the media section. --[Hoehrer](User:Hoehrer "wikilink")
