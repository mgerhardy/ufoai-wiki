Using the knowledge of the recently reverse-engineered Antarean ion
thruster technology, Phalanx has advanced UGV-technology (Unmanned
Ground Vehicle) to create this mobile, hovering, autonomous weapon. The
Phoenix can achieve strategic manuevers such as floating at any point in
mid-air, scouting/attacking through second-story windows, and landing on
rooftops. Though one disadvantage it shares with the Triax - its size -
remains.
