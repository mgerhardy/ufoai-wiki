Control Interface"

\[ufo_txt\] The alien UFOs take their power directly from the fabric of
space itself using a technology we are currently unable to reproduce
ourselves. Control is via a dir ect neural interface based on psionic
technology. The engines distort space, cre ating a wave in 4-dimensional
space and riding the leading edge.

TODO: 2 different engines? Distortion engine only operates in space,
away from the gravity well of planets. Perhaps the distortion engine
could just be on a mothership, which sends down UFOs with in-well
engines? Could have a gateway out be yond the solar-system in deep space
which takes them back to their own system instantaneously.
