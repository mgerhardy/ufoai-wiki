According to data translated from an alien palm computer, the Alien
Mothership is the command center of the alien invasion. It's armaments
are such that it could destroy a whole fleet of human vessels in a short
time, making a direct attack impossible. We can only hope to find a safe
way to board this ship and destroy it from the inside.

TODO: location of the ship. TODO: Explaination of why it isn't worth
attacking directly.
