Using robotics and artificial intelligence, Phalanx has developed an
all-purpose all-terrain assault vehicle for use in ground combat without
the need for human intervention. The autonomous Triax UGV (Unmanned
Ground Vehicle) has three axles and six-wheel suspension for
manueverability on all terrains. It comes complete with heavy armor,
AI-controlled (arificial intelligence) enemy recognition and machine gun
turret. For tactical reasons the control is a hybrid of autonomous and
remote control, which provides greater flexibility in situations the
artificial intelligence may not recognize/act correctly. The AI is
mostly used for quick enemy recognition and precise attacks. The only
downside when using this rolling fortress of doom is the fact that it
takes up alot of space in the dropship and can't reach every destination
that provides enough room for it or is otherwise unreachable for
ground-based units.
