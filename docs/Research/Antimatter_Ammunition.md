**SUB:** Proposal: Antimatter Ammunition

Commander, our research into antimatter weaponry has given us a lot of
ideas for creating new weapons and modifying our old ones. Unfortunately
it has also highlighted crippling limitations on most of them.

Using antimatter in our conventional firearms -- in any capacity -- is
out of the question. There are too many shocks and vibrations involved
in chemical propellant firearms for us to shield against. All attempts
we've made have suffered containment failures and other mishaps.
However, it's occurred to us that our own Bolter Rifle may be just
unconventional enough for our needs.

What we propose to do is to create a new type of ammunition for the
Bolter using antimatter as a primary component. If we can place a tiny
quantity of antimatter at the heart of the round, we can engineer this
antimatter to break free of its containment and explode on impact. This
should create an impressive little blast that will make any alien think
twice about sticking its head out of cover again.

Please let me know whenever you'd like us to start work, Commander.
