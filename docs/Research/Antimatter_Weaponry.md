**FROM:** Cdr. Paul Navarre, R&D: Engineering Division, PHALANX,
Atlantic Operations Command

**SUB:** Proposal: Antimatter Weaponry

Commander, the uses of antimatter in weaponry is obvious. It has the
highest energy to mass ratio in the universe. It can be used both as a
propellant and as payload for any number of bullets, bombs, missiles and
more. It would've been introduced into human warfare long ago if we were
able to produce worthwhile quantities of it.

This is why we now look to the aliens as our main source for antimatter,
and why our options to work with antimatter are very limited. There are
a thousand possible applications for every antiproton we can get our
hands on. The decision of what is and isn't worthwhile is going to be
difficult, but we at DivEngine can thrash out the most promising and
economical ideas for your review.

However, to do all of that we need a significant amount of funding and
lab time for testing and prototyping purposes. This will require your
authorisation, Commander, and I think it should be one of our top
priorities due to the sheer potential of antimatter's unexplored uses in
the war effort.
