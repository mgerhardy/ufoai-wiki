Hmm. Why the UFO-Harvester is "small", while its dimensions are
identical with the UFO-Supply Ship, described as "medium"

Anyone know why I always get these annoying buggers as the first UFO and
they apparently have antimatter missiles? Usually you are supposed to be
able to shoot down everything except the occasional gigantic ship in the
first month. [Muton commander](User:Muton_commander "wikilink") 02:57, 7
