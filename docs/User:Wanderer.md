Just a random guy who found this project online looking for an old
favorite. This is the best rework I've seen so far that doesn't cut
corners, or 'improve' things that would have been better off left alone
(UFO:ExtraTerrestrials, \*cough\*).

Professionally I'm a Database Administrator/Architect/Lead Developer for
MS SQL Server, and a DBA/Developer II for most other database types
(besides Oracle).

Gamewise I'm your average joe, trying to help out when I can.

See ya flipside.
