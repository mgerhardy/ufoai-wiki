## Proposal

**TO:** Base Commander, PHALANX, Atlantic Operations Command

**FROM:** Cdr. Paul Navarre, R&D: Engineering Division, PHALANX,
Atlantic Operations Command

**DATE:** %02i %s %i

**SUB:** Proposal: Alien Artifact -- Plasma Blaster

Commander, we've recovered an alien plasma blaster from the field. This
is an extremely powerful new plasma weapon that warrants immediate
research. Preliminary testing confirms that blaster shots tear right
through our Combat Armour and have a far longer range than the other
plasma weapons we've recovered.

Please authorise this research program at your earliest convenience.

**SUB:** Re: Alien Artifact -- Plasma Blaster

Commander, here's my report on our alien plasma blaster research.

This is the heaviest member we've observed out of the plasma weapon
family. The heavy-duty plasma chamber and upgraded plastic spinnerets
are capable of producing an extraordinarily large and deadly ball of
plasma. The blaster sacrifices accuracy for power, making this a more
effective weapon for close quarters engagements.

We recommend that any enemies found carrying one be neutralised ASAP, as
they are an extreme threat to everyone and everything in the line of
fire.

Our troops should now be able to train with and use the plasma blaster
in combat as any other weapon.
