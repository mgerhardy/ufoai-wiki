## Introduction

For soldiers to battle somewhere, there have to be maps. We use a tool
called UFORadiant. This page, and many of the articles in the [mapping
category](:Category:Mapping "wikilink"), will introduce you to the tool
and document many of its capabilities.

Mapping is one of the most flexible ways to contribute because quality
maps of almost all kinds can be incorporated into the game. The whole
world is the battlefield.

But some contributions are more helpful than others.

We use small map pieces (tiles) and fit them together in random ways to
create the battlefields the player faces. We call this a [random map
assembly](Mapping/Random_map_assembly "wikilink") (RMA) theme, and we
always appreciate it when people extend existing themes by making
[additional tiles](Mapping/Random_map_parts "wikilink"). Get familiar
with one of [our many themes](Mapping/List_of_Maps "wikilink") (prefixed
with a +) and you can easily create a new tile.

If you want a little more independence, we have a long list of
[suggested maps](Mapping/Suggestions "wikilink") and new
[prefabs](Mapping/Prefabs "wikilink") are always welcome. You can also
see what's on our [TODO/General](TODO/General "wikilink") list.
Contributing to something on the [TODO/General](TODO/General "wikilink")
list is sometimes less glamorous but very appreciated.

Like other contributions to UFO AI, your maps should be released under
GNU GPL (preferably v2 with "or later" clause) and should not use any
proprietary material: beware of textures/images/models found on the web.
Only materials created from scratch or materials that are already
licensed under GNU GPL should be used.

But before you worry about any of that, you should get started below
with UFORadiant.
