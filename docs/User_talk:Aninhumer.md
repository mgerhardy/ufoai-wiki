Hi Aninhumer!

Thank you for your work. I'm not sure if you know, but a complete
rewrite of the ufopedia is in progress by the storyline guys. This is
why devs are busy and generally there is not much traffic on the wiki
(most of the changes will be wiped out, anyway). I only hope some of
yours and other's work on the wiki is used in the rewrite, so that we
don't feel our work is wasted... If you want your questions answered,
the best way seems to be IRC at the moment.
