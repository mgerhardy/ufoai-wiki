This file has a lot of information that is already at
[UFO-Scripts/campaign.ufo](UFO-Scripts/campaign.ufo "wikilink"). Perhaps
make it more in the style of [tweak weapons](tweak_weapons "wikilink"),
that is more informal and more advice, and refer to
[UFO-Scripts/campaign.ufo](UFO-Scripts/campaign.ufo "wikilink") for
listing of keywords, etc.
