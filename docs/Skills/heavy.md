## Official Description

The Heavy Weapons skill represents training in the use of support
weapons. These weapons tend to create more damage than the widely issued
rifles and pistols, but also tend to have more weight and produce more
recoil.

Character needs to hit enemies 4 times to gain one point of this skill.

### Battle Implications

The Flamethrower is a weapon that is unique in the PHALANX arsenal. It
has a short range, but always hits once in range. Additionally, flame
damage is effective even against armored opponents.

Some players like to use a rapid fire weapon in reaction fire placed
behind your advancing troops to discourage enemies from taking potshots
at you. This concept is known as "suppressive fire". This is primarily
the function of the Machine Gun. The Assault Rifle in "Full-Auto" mode
can do this, but is not as accurate to hit. No other rapid fire weapon
has a range equal or exceeding that of the Machine Gun.

The heavy weapons developed by the aliens \[Plasma Blaster/Particle
Accelerator Cannon\] produce large amounts of damage, but have short
ranges and significant TU costs.
