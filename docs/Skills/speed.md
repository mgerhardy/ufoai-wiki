## Official Description

Speed represents how fast a soldier moves. The attribute mainly affects
how many [time units](Skills/time_units "wikilink") (TU) a soldier has.
TU are, arguably, the most important survival characteristics of a
soldier, so the speed attribute should not be underestimated. Morever
the skill determines the initiative (who shoots first) when [reaction
fire](reaction_fire "wikilink") is triggered.
