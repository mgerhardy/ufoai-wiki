## Official Description

The High-Explosives skill represents a soldier's ability to use
grenades, and weapons with a splash damage effect (whether caused by a
high-explosive ammunition or any other ammunition, even alien). A
soldier with a big High-Explosives skill is better at landing the charge
at the spot where he wants it: at the feet of the enemy or, if the spot
is unreachable, still close enough to harm him. A soldier trained in
this skill will also be more attuned to a launcher's recoil and more
accustomed to its fire trajectory, increasing accuracy.

Character needs to hit enemies 5 times to gain one point of this skill.

### Battle Implications

Explosive weapons can damage all beings within their 'Blast Radius'.
This is good if several aliens are congregated together, but bad if
soldiers \[or civilians\] are near your target. It can also be
problematic if your shot misses its target. It is a good idea for a
soldier carrying an explosive weapon to have a secondary weapon for when
the enemy gets too close.

Several of the hand grenades do not cause damage, but create other
special effects. These are listed below.

Note: UFO:AI 2.3 has changed such that there are no longer **any**
explosive weapons that are capable of reaction fire. If the ability to
fire defensively is important to you, then don't use any explosive
primary weapons.

The Rocket Launcher is a unique weapon that deserves its own discussion.

Pros:

- Range. No weapon has a longer reach than the Rocket Launcher. There
  are only two weapons with equal range, the Sniper Rifle and the Bolter
  Rifle.
- Accuracy. Rockets have a narrower 'spread' than any weapon on the
  battlefield. Only the Lasers even come close.
- Firepower. HE Rockets do more damage than any other weapon available
  in the beginning of a campaign.

Cons:

- Unlike most other weapons, the Rocket Launcher does not have a
  magazine. You have to reload each time you pull the trigger. Carrying
  more than a few rockets will fill up your backpack.
- The Rocket Launcher is incapable of reaction fire. Make sure some
  other of your soldiers cover the gunner of your Rocket Launcher from
  surprise attack.
- The Rocket Launcher is the only weapon in the campaign that uses a
  two-handed hold. You can't use a Medikit, Flashbang or any other item
  without setting the launcher on the ground.
