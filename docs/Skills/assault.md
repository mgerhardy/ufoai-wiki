## Official Description

The Assault Guns skill reflects a soldier's proficiency with assault
weapons. The assault skill is a combination of the ability to quickly
identify friend from foe in tight combat situations, and to fire a rifle
at the latter, not the former. Weapons that use the Assault Guns skill
tend to be good all-round weapons, with decent damage, accuracy and rate
of fire.

Character needs to hit enemies 3 times to gain one point of this skill.

### Battle Implications

Since the 'main' weapon at any stage of the game will be some form of
assault rifle, it is nice to have many soldiers with good levels of this
skill.
