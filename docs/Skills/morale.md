- Morale damage is damage dependant (the greater injure is the graither
  morale change will be).
- Death hurts morale even more than just damage.
- Seeing how someone (from the same team) gets shot, increases the
  morale change (morale change is increased for each visible actor being
  shot).
  - For friendly fire morale change is bigger than one for enemy fire.
- Seeing a civil die demages morale.
- If an ally (or in singleplayer mode, as human, a civilian) got shot,
  the morale os lowered.
- If and actor stands near to the attacker or the victim, the morale
  change is higher.
- Morale damage is dependant on the number of living allies (the more
  aliens are alive the higher demage is).

Maximum value for morale depends on value of characters
[mind](Skills/mind "wikilink") skill.

When morale decrease to specific value (in current version - 30)
character starts to panic.
