## Official Description

The Sniper Rifles skill represents a soldier's skill to aim a weapon
very accurately, provided the weapon is designed for that. Most weapons
used with that skill are indeed sniper rifles, but there are exceptions
--- long range, high accuracy fire mode of any weapon is bound to
require Sniper Rifles skill.

Character needs to hit enemies 3 times to gain one point of this skill.

### Battle Implications

Being able to "reach out and touch someone" can be incredibly useful, at
least for the outdoors portion of a mission. Many squads have a
dedicated sniper. This individual will generally go toward the the point
of the map offering the best visibility, usually a rooftop or hill. Note
that the Headshot fire mode causes more damage than any other weapon
than the Particle Beam Cannon, and will be more necessary as the enemy
gets better armored.
