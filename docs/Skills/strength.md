## Official Description

Power reflects a soldier's physical strength. A high physical strength
is especially important for soldiers who handle [heavy
weapons](Skills/heavy "wikilink") and armor, as well as soldiers who
fight in close quarters. Power directly influences the damage a soldier
can do in melee combat, and how well a soldier is able to handle a
weapon's recoil. Recoil decreases accuracy, so a soldier using a weapon
with a lot of recoil needs strength to keep it pointing in the right
direction when firing.

Power also affects soldier's [health
points](Skills/health_points "wikilink") (HP) and the amount of
equipment a soldier can carry before he becomes encumbered. An
encumbered soldier suffers a [time units](Skills/time_units "wikilink")
(TU) penalty, as well as an [accuracy](Skills/accuracy "wikilink")
penalty.

To gain one point of power skill your soldier needs to hit 8 enemies
with any [heavy weapon](Skills/heavy "wikilink").
