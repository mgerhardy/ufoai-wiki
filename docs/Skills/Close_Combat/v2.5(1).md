## Official Description

The Close Combat skill represents a soldier's proficiency with
close-ranged weapons. A soldier with a high Close Combat skill is better
at aiming a pistol at a fast moving enemy, and can also wield a blade
better in combat, increasing damage dealt. Fire modes affected by the
Close Combat skill are always short range and have relatively low TU
costs.

### Battle Implications

Close Combat or Secondary weapons are useful anytime you can't or
shouldn't fire your primary weapon. A typical example is when a friendly
would be in the blast radius of an explosive weapon. Some players also
like to use one of their soldiers as a "Corpsman" or dedicated medic.
This type of character will carry the Medikit in one hand and a pistol
\[or other one-handed weapon\] in the other.

After combat has moved inside a building or ship, range becomes less
important, while TU usage becomes more important. Close Combat weapons
shine in such cases.
