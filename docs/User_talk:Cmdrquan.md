## Random Thoughts

Here are some one line ideas I've had that may already be present (I
need to familiarize myself with the game/code some more):

- I saw an alienFriendly variable for nations. As regions succumb to and
  are assimilated by aliens, why not fight AGAINST alien-friendly
  humans?

<!-- -->

- Transfer takes time, but hiring/buying is instantaneous - it shouldn't
  be.

<!-- -->

- Add a selection sound list to be used when a soldier is selected on
  the battlescape that is nationality dependent. (e.g. a bitish-american
  soldier says 'yes','roger',etc.)

## Current task

[TODO/2.3](TODO/2.3 "wikilink") : Other

- Generate soldier names depending on their nation of origin. Change
  team_humans.ufo so it defines names per nation rather than per class.
