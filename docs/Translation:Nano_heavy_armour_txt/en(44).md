## Official Description

An armor that completely surrounds the soldier's body, effectively
quarantining the soldier from his or her environment. The fabric of the
armor consists of three plies, of which the first and the third are made
of fullerene nano-material. In the middle our scientists put a special
heavy screen shielding against tachyon particles --- for the first time
in this war our soldiers receive a protection from this deadly exotic
radiation. Its effectiveness in diffusing tachyon radiation is estimated
to be comparable to that of the aliens armor types. The internal life
support and the hardness of the armor render any form of stun agents
ineffective, be it ultra-high frequency sound waves, drug-injecting
projectiles, stun gas, or just toxic fumes.

### Battle Implications

The two plies of fabric woven of linked fullerene rings offer great
protection, but their outer layers still melt relatively easily on
contact with plasma. However, the armor is designed to withstand
prolonged exposition to any harsh conditions, including open fire and
medium intensity plasma beams. The price of this robustness is that the
suit is very heavy, so that only very powerful soldiers will be able to
wear it comfortably.
