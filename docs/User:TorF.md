Hi ! I'm Coder and here the subjects I have worked on :

- Map / Geoscape : multi selection of elements (base, aircraft, mission,
  UFO...)
- Aircraft popup to give them orders (back to base, stop, move to
  mission...)
- UFOs on Geoscape : radars, aircrafts chasing ufo...
- Translations for French language.
