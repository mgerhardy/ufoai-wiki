The game already seems to assume a light tracer effect for most weapons.
In terms of realism, anything fired on a bullet-like trajectory is going
to be too transient to provide target illumination sufficient to be
noticeable compared to muzzle-flash. Some kind of flare round for use in
the grenade launcher might be nice, though.
