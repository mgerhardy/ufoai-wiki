## Tooltip?

Shouldn't this information really be in a tooltip in the game when you
select the weapon type? Hearing that a SMG uses the "close" skill isn't
terribly intuitive to me, it really should be treated as an assault
weapon since it has a lot more in common with firing an assault rifle
than using a knife. [Parjlarsson](User:Parjlarsson "wikilink") 02:34, 2

## Common sense shooting weapons/military stuff.

Hi. I'm not a super-weapons guy, but I have experience shooting pistols,
rifles, sniper weapons, shotguns and your run-of-the-mill infantry
assault rifles. Shooting a shotgun is about the same whether you're
shooting this or that ammo. No sense splitting up the skills. It should
all be assault, really. Rocket Launcher and Grenade Launcher should just
be lumped into heavy, or re-name the category to "<Something> Launcher
weapons". While we're at it, a SMG is usually fired with two hands and
carried in a ready position across the chest or aimed where you're
looking if it's a sharp tactical situation. It's not something you go
jogging along with in an easy-carry pistol hold. I see little need
overall to have different modes of firing the same weapon take different
skill-sets. That's just needlessly obtuse and over-complicating
something. [Parjlarsson](User:Parjlarsson "wikilink") 05:36, 4 May 2011
