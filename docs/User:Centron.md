## Official Description

Frequent wikipedia editor and poster. Spends his time off the wiki and
the forums looking at other message boards or playing X-COM on
Superhuman difficulty. (swearing when all of his squaddies fall to one
shot) He also plays other games that have close to the same mechanics as
X-COM, such as UFO: Aftermath and UFO: Aftershock.

### Battle Implications

Ability to spam chat messages when equipped with a keyboard makes him
highly effective against machines or cyborg enemies. Also effective
against organic enemies due to skills in swearing and extreme
downtalking gained from Drill Sargeant experience.

### Damage Type

Burn (Forum Flaming)

### Notes

Swearing ability charged by not posting his opinions of other morons on
forums he frequents. \*\*\*Warning\*\*\* If he encounters an
out-of-the-ordinary super-retarded idiot on the forums who doesn't know
what he's talking about, swearing can be overcharged and may result in
extreme friendly fire to squadmates.
