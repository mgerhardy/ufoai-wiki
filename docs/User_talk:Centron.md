Hey I was wondering if I could get a job working on ufoai as maybe
helping with website and wiki. I am willing to work for nothing. I can
also pitch ideas for game, and help make the game as realistic as
possible (for an alien invasion game lol) with my knowledge of past,
present, and future weapons of the human armed forces. Please email me
at CentronT2 AT aim.com if I can help with anything.

Feel free to add suggestions of weapon/equipment description, but we
already have alot of them (See especially ) and only the ones that are
missing there (and not yet entered in the wiki) are needed. You already
added alot of descriptions that are already there. :) PS: you can sign
your text with --\~\~\~\~ or --\~\~\~. This will produce something like
my own signature --\> --[Hoehrer](User:Hoehrer "wikilink") 17:13, 6 June
