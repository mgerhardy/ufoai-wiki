## pls check

Could you please check the translating I am doing, and let me know if it
is ok? Is it enough to translate in the wiki page? Thanks

So far the translations you did look good (altough I can't check the
spelling/grammar itself since I don't speak italian myself:)). As long
as the structure is left the same (as the original English version) and
a link is provided in the "msgid" list the automatic translation
(wiki-\>game) should work just fine.
