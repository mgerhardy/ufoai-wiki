About that entry: Items (and captured/killed aliens) from a mission are
now transferred into the base when the aircraft returns to it, not on
the end of the mission (Coders: see CL_DropshipReturned)

This is not finished. I mean, indeed captured/killed aliens are being
added to Containment when aircraft reaches base, and indeed this is
being done by CL_DropshipReturned(), but Items collecting is still beind
done old way, that is collecting and selling to the market right after
the mission. I have plans to rewrite the code doing this and move it to
CL_DropshipReturned().--[Zenerka](User:Zenerka "wikilink") 14:10, 16

My bad, I tried to fix the entry. Better now? :)
