## Maps

- Add [cameras](Mapping/Entities/misc_camera "wikilink") to phalanx base
  map.

  - bug needs to be fixed

- During game balancing the number of aliens was raised for some UFO
  types. We need to check the mapdefs to fit those numbers. Else, this
  will possibly cause a regression in the map diversity. And if we raise
  the maxaliens parameter in the mapdef, we need to make sure there are
  enough spawnpoints on the map.

  - It seems the game doesnÂ´t take this numbers into accout when
    selecting a map. So this is no problem at all.
