Remaining bit of the description, so that we can remove alien_types.txt:

\[cyborg_ortnok_autopsy_txt\] Separating the cyborg endoskeleton from
the specimen's flesh generates sparks and releases choking, acidic
vapours. The internals of the endoskeleton slide out of access holes in
the artificial bone structure, attached to surgically implanted tendrils
that appear to be bio-mechanical. It seems that digestive systems and
reproductive organs have been removed and replaced by numerous small
engines encased within the endoskeleton. Energy created by the
chlorophyll in the Ortnok's skin appears to kick-start the reactions in
these micro-engines. The purpose of the Antarean cyborg programme is
clearly the conversion of the Ortnok into a bio-mechanical weapons
platform that demands much greater energy output and suppression of the
reproductive instinct.
