Remaining bit of the description, so that we can remove alien_types.txt:

\[hovernet_autopsy_txt\] Untangling the network of loose, fibrous
material that forms at least 90% of the hovernet reveals a solid disc of
unknown construction. Mounting points for weaponry are clearly visible,
though the markings alongside them have yet to be deciphered and would
be our first breakthrough in understanding the alien language. No joints
can be seen between the disc and the dozens of fibres that protrude from
it, even under an electron microscope. It is possible that the fibres
are extruded from the disc itself, which must provide the most efficient
distribution of the hovernet's energy and propulsive force. The loose
arrangement of the fibres suggests that a successful hit with a
projectile or directed energy weapon is unlikely, and blast or
incendiary weapons would have greater effect.
