6\. "Ortnok Warrior"

\[ortnok_medium_txt\] Having the same genetic features as the regular
Ortnoks, the Ortnok Warriors have been\n extensively modified with
cybernetic implants. All these additional implants obviously aim to\n
achieve a better performance in combat. Therefore the legs and arms have
been almost completely\n replaced by cybernetic prostheses which allow a
physical strength far beyond the potential of a\n human being. The claw
shaped hands are designed to handle extreme weights. The chest area is\n
covered with a thick steel plating which is almost impenetrable for
regular rifle ammunition.\n The face mask serves as a protection against
hazardous gases as well as a augmentation of the\n upper airways to
allow a better lung function. The disadvantage of this massive
cybernetic\n augmentation is the increased vulnerability to
electromagnetic pulses (EMP).
