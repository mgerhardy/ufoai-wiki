I'm a big fan of this project and X-Com, one of the best games ever
made. I have an extensive gaming experience, especially with strategy,
tactical and RPG games. Some of my all time favourites, besides X-Com,
are: Fallout (and sequels), Jagged Alliance, C&C + Tiberian Sun,
Neverwinter Nights, Heroes of Might and Magic, Master of Orion 2 and
many more.

I created this account hoping that some of my ideas to be useful to the
project. I'm the guy with the [Dirty Harry's
gun](Equipment/Proposed/Dirty_Harry's_Revolver "wikilink") idea :), so
please don't stun me for some alien containment room!

I think this project can be a great succes, so any contribution might
lead to a better gaming experience.
