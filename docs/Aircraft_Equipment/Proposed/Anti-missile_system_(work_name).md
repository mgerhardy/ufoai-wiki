This system has ben inspired by systems ARENA/STORA on (old) russians
main battle tanks. This system simply fire solid projectiles against
incoming enemy projectiles/missiles with certain chance to destroy it
before hitting plane. It have pros and cons compared to ECM. Pros - it
can destroy projectiles that can not be affected by ECM ("dumb"
munition, ECM resist missiles etc.) Cons - heavier than ECM with limited
ammo.
