A new ammunition type for the TR-20 Rocket Launcher, a Plasma-Lance
Rocket operates on the same principle as the Plasma Blade. On the front
of each rocket is a magnetic clamp. When a rocket scores a hit, the
magnetic clamp secures the warhead to the hull and the rear section of
the rocket (the engine) detaches and falls away. Inside the warhead is a
mechanism similar to the Plasma Blade, but larger. It will burn through
the UFO's armor and cause good damage. The downside is these rockets are
expensive and time-consuming to produce, and are slightly less accurate
than the regular TR-20 Rockets.
