Interesting choice of user name. Something tells me you're Greek, am I
right? If so, [myself](User:ouroboros "wikilink") and
[nmamos](User:nmamos "wikilink") are working on translating the game to
Greek, we'd be glad to have your help if you're interested in
translating or just brainstorming.

If you're interested then send me an email through the UFO wiki (the
"E-mail this user" link on the left side of the page) or simply write in
my discussion page. If not or if I was mistaken then feel free to delete
what I wrote.
