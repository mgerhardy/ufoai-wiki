# Memo

**TO:** Base Commander, PHALANX, Atlantic Operations Command

**FROM:** Cdr. Paul Navarre, R&D: Engineering Division, PHALANX,
Atlantic Operations Command

**DATE:** %02i %s %i

**SUB:** Memo: UFO Yard

Commander, our last mission killed the UFO's crew but we have nowhere to
store the craft. The UFO is too large to house within our own base's
engineering and research facilities. You should build a UFO Yard as soon
as possible so that we can store the alien vehicles at an off-base
installation. We won't be able to conduct any research on the crafts
until we can safely store them.

Once we have a UFO in storage, our scientists can get to work conducting
their research. Once their done, our engineers will be able to
disassemble the UFO to collect materials and parts.

Work on the UFOs will force our scientists and engineers to move back
and forth between the base and the UFO yard, so build the site as close
as possible to the base where the work is being conducted.

--Cdr. Navarre
