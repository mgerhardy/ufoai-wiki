I'm using some spare time that i have, to translate part of the game
into Estonian. If in any time someone would want to get some accurate
reference in en-et or et-en i can recommend
[dukelupus](http://www.dukelupus.pri.ee/dict/) dictionary. Btw. Firefox
plug-in of this dictionary is also available. I study
informatics(computer science) at TTÃœ, Tallinn, Estonia.
