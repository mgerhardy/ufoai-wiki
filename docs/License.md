## Accepted licenses

- v2.0 or later, short: "GPL2" (mainly code and art assets)

- short: "GFDL" (documentation)

- short: "CC-BY-SA3" (art assets)

Note: We do not accept any "**NonCommercial**" (NC) licenses.

## Rules for contributors

- When contributing code, be aware that all of our code is released
  under GPL.
- When contributing art assets, state which license you chose and
  provide your name for attribution.

### Derivative works

If your contribution contains models, sounds, textures or other art
assets by others, additional rules apply:

- We (UFO:AI) will only accept art assets covered by [\#Accepted
  Licenses](#Accepted_Licenses "wikilink").
- Include additional info into your submission (readme.txt file
  preferred) about:
  1.  License of the original assets used in your work.
  2.  Author(s) of the original assets used in your work.
  3.  Source of the original assets used in your work (URL).
- Preserve license compatibility; if you used sound samples released
  under CC-BY-SA, your work also must be released under CC-BY-SA.

If license information is missing from original assets, they cannot be
used for UFO:AI art assets. *No license* means *no permission* and does
not mean *no copyright*.
