<translate> This is a single-player, military-themed invasion scenario.
The player assumes command of Project PHALANX, Earth's response to the
alien threat, and can play through a dynamic game with both significant
random elements and a strong overarching storyline.

This campaign is available at several difficulty levels. This option
represents the Standard difficulty level, and is recommended for
first-time players who like a challenge. </translate>
