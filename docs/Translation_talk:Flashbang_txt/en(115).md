## Functions

Maybe a flashbang should just decrease the amount of remaining TUs - or
it should deactivate reactionfire of opponents or friendly soldiers
(except the thrower, that are looking into the same direction.

That has been the plan from the beginning. Disable reaction fire for
everyone looking at the flashbang, friendlies and aliens and civilians
alike -- all except the thrower.

Of course some enemies would have to be immune to this effect.

As the flashbang makes you blind, it should disable fire at all or maybe
make the shoots a bit random a few turns, until its efects dissapears.

Damage Type is blast ?
