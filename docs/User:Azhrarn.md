### Azhrarn, named in humble tribute to The Prince of Demons

For those of you that do not know \`The Tales From The Flat Earth' by
Tanith Lee, I strongly recommend that you get your hands on a copy and
meet the real Night's Master.

I am an IT consultant with a long history of doing code for all kinds of
stuff.

I relish in the thrills of reducing code size while increasing
capabilities.
