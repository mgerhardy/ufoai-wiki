--Alien KKV launcher(pre-research)--

Sir, we have a specimen of the most destructive weapon in the alien's
arsenal. And destructive it is indeed. Footage captured during our first
encounter with this weapon shows it blasting apart tanks, buildings, and
our own infantry with single shots. Test firing done so far nearly
destroyed the lab's firing range.

Commander, we *must* figure out how this works *immediately*. We have to
find a counter to this weapon, or we risk more losses on the front
lines.

--Alien KKV launcher(post-research)--

We have finally figured out how this monster works. It's a simple, but
effective design.

The "launcher", as we've deemed it, is nothing more than a tube with
grips, a trigger, and a sight attached. The "projectile" is inserted in
the back, where a magnetic locking system holds it in place until the
trigger is pulled. Then said holding mechanism flings the projectile
free.

But that's not the scary part. The projectile is.

The projectile is a antimatter powered rocket without an explosive
warhead. At the speed it goes at, it packs a wallop on it's own. Two
variants have been observed: solid(most likely for anti-material
purposes)and flechette(the rocket fragments in flight to make a titanic
shotgun).
