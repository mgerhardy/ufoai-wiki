# Starting a single player game

UFO: Alien Invasion offers two kind of long run campaign agains the
extraterrestrial forces and a quick skirmish mode.

## Campaign mode

Support your role of commander of the PHALANX project and run the war
against the aliens to preserve humanity. You will have to prove that
PHALANX is the most effective way to counter the menace. Run operations
all around the globe to keep the nations united on the project and build
it ever more until the final victory.

Both the campaigns shares the same rules, researches and objectives, but
the way the alien behaves is different. To start a new campaign select
Single player on the main menu, choose the type of campaign and
difficulty you want and your mission starts.

Do you want to jump right in and just play? Then read the [quickstart
guide](Manual/Singleplayer/Quickstart "wikilink").

same as the aliens react to your operations.

missions.

## Skirmish

Skirmish is a stand-alone ground mission against aliens.

death.
