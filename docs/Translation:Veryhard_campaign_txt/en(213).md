This is an extremely difficult version of the Standard Campaign. In this
scenario, all the odds will be stacked against you, you will receive few
recruits, and the nations will be extremely demanding. The aliens will
show you no mercy.

This option represents the Very Hard difficulty level, and is
recommended for those who have managed to beat the Hard campaign and
still feel the need to further punish themselves.
