If each small piece of ammo (or grenades) counts as 1 item, a capacity
of only 50 items will be far too low.

E.g. 49 grenades of size 10x10x10cm fit into one drawer of 70x70x10cm.

I think this needs a discussion. Myself I'd like a simple system when
only item count counts (then, of course, increase the storage size to
100, 200, or something). I could even try to explain the realism of it
with some skewed logic. OR, make it only weight-based, because soon all
items will have weight. But I think this is even less realistic and
weight will have enough use for soldier encumberance... OR count the
number of squares item takes in inventory. Not bad, that...
