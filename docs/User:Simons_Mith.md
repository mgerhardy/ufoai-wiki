I'm a professional technical writer currently between jobs. I also do
proofreading and editing. Some of the prose here is rather ropey,
frankly. I will fix the odd typo when I encounter them, but if anyone
wants to send me a priority list of documents to work on, I'll be glad
to oblige.

I'll show up on the forums too and post a similar offer, but probably
not for a few weeks yet as I'm busy IRL. Despite being between jobs...

Put any requests on my talk page. I have looked at the Wiki
contributions section already, but haven't spotted any *specific*
requests for material that needs work done to it.
