**Reenen**: I know this is quite early, (and I played version 0.12
rather than 0.13) but some extra documentation is needed.

I wanted to do some work on an explaination screen with controls etc.,
but I am still figuring them out as I go.

But basically, a screenshot of the *HUD*, and then indicate on the top
1-8 buttons that it is your "team". And on the left 1-8, indicate that
it is the "cut" level. (What is the UFO:AI jargon for that?) How the
firing, dropping, throwing, etc. will work. The rotate, +zoom, -zoom,
camera switch etc. keys.

Also an indicator that the number on the top right is the amount of
spotted aliens by your *team*.

And so on... basically that the UI is friendly, and that a new user can
start easily.

## already there

**mattn**: this point is already in the todo-list

this in meant to be the part of the tutorials (see also the sequence
stuff) there you can add your images and some descriptive text (but
text, as text and not in the image - due to translation reasons)

## What? Where? Huh?

This page should redirect to the current valid TODO, the page is
confusing and the visitor doesn't want the history of TODOs, he wants to
know which is the current.
