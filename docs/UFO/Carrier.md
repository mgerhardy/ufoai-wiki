Commander, we've shot down and recovered one of the large UFOs from high
Earth orbit. This is an extremely important development. These massive
craft seem to serve as orbital base ships for deploying formations of
smaller UFOs, with huge antimatter tanks and -- most interestingly -- an
alien Faster-Than-Light drive. We should strip this UFO right away to
get our hands on its unique technology.

We're ready to start studying and dismantling the craft at your say-so,
but we will need some lab time and funding to make a proper assessment
of its function and capabilities.

Commander, my team and I have just finished our work on the Carrier UFO.
I'll try and keep it brief.

The highlights:

The FTL drive was recovered intact. We've moved it to a secure storage
for further research.

We now have a decent idea about the interior layout of these Carriers,
as well as their equipment and onboard systems. If we could get there,
we might be able to force entry from one of the landing pads.

The remaining Carriers have moved away into a higher orbit where our
improvised space gun won't have any reasonable chance of hitting them.
