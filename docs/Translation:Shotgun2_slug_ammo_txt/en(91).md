------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Overview

This is a magazine filled with 7 saboted shotgun slugs. These slugs are
encased in hard plastic shells, 'sabots', which break away shortly after
leaving the barrel. The sabots are fired from a rifled barrel and can
travel at far higher velocities than ordinary slugs or shotshells. The
slugs themselves are made of aluminium-cored steel; their power is not
to be underestimated. When fired from a high-powered shotgun, these
slugs can damage even armoured vehicles.

The magazine is meant to be loaded into a CRC-212 Riot Shotgun. It will
not fit into the CRC-M9 Micro Shotgun.

### Recommended Doctrine

All soldiers equipped with shotguns should carry at least one reload
whenever they go out in the field. It is not advisable to send our
troops into combat without spare magazines.

### Addenda

None.
