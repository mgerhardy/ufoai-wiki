## Overpowered.

I realize the game is set in a far future, but right now in 2.4 dev this
thing works as a magic potion and is far superior to letting people heal
up in hospitals - to the point that you're better off NOT killing the
last alien just so you can run around and heal people up. Personal pref
would be for this to work as a bleeding-wound stopper instead. While I'm
at it, I'd suggest having a person who gets shot immediately crouch down
and lose half their remaining TUs from that round assuming they took
more than a glancing blow. But that's just me, I like things more
challenging and more realistic - I realize not everyone does.
