<p>It is the year 2084. You control a secret organisation charged with
defending Earth from a brutal alien enemy. Build up your bases, prepare
your team, and dive head-first into the fast and flowing turn-based
combat.</p>
<p><strong>UFO: Alien Invasion</strong> is a squad-based tactical
strategy game in the tradition of the old <em>X-COM</em> PC games, but
with a twist. Our game combines military realism with hard
science-fiction and the weirdness of an alien invasion. The carefully
constructed turn-based system gives you pin-point control of your squad
while maintaining a sense of pace and danger.</p>
<p>Over the long term you will need to conduct research into the alien
threat to figure out their mysterious goals and use their powerful
weapons for your own ends. You will produce unique items and use them in
combat against your enemies. If you like, you can even use them against
your friends with our multiplayer functionality.</p>
<p><em>UFO: Alien Invasion</em>. Endless hours of gameplay — absolutely
free.</p>
<p>The game takes a lot of inspiration from the <em>X-COM</em> series by
Mythos and Microprose. However, it's neither a sequel nor a remake of
any <em>X-COM</em> or other commercial title. What we as a team wanted
to make is a brand new experience that tries to surpass the quality of
games from 1992, rather than simply recreate them with flashier
graphics.</p>
<p>We also believe that open-source projects don't need to be
disorganised or badly-managed. We work together in a friendly and
professional way, with a clear vision for a game that we know is worth
playing.</p>
<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
<p>Like the original <em>X-COM</em> games, <em>UFO:AI</em> has two main
modes of play: <strong>Geoscape</strong> mode and
<strong>Tactical</strong> mode.</p>
<p>In <em>Geoscape</em> mode, the game is about base management and
strategy. You manage the activities and finances of PHALANX, controlling
bases, installations, aircraft and squads of armed-response troops.
You'll research new technologies and use their results in battle against
the aliens. You'll launch your interceptor aircraft to shoot down UFOs
and dispatch dropships in response to alien activity across the globe.
You can build, buy and produce anything you like, as long as your
technology level and your budget will allow it.</p>
<p><em>Geoscape</em> mode employs easy-to-use time buttons to control
the passage of time however you like, automatically pausing whenever
there's an important message for you to see. Research will progress and
items will be produced as time passes.</p>
<p>In <em>Tactical</em> mode, the game is about taking command of your
team in various missions to combat the aliens wherever they might
appear. Instead of pushing imperonal armies around on giant maps, you
use only the team of soldiers you've assigned to deal with this mission
— the same soldiers which you've managed and equipped to your
satisfaction in Geoscape mode. You may find civilians and other
bystanders during the mission, being targeted and executed by the
aliens, or just getting in the way while you're trying to protect them.
It's a dangerous world, and some of your men will die.</p>
<p><em>Tactical</em> mode uses a turn-based system, where your team and
the aliens take turns to make moves. During your turn you can order your
troops to move around, fire their weapons, throw grenades or use other
equipment, etc. Each soldier gets a certain number of Time Units (TUs),
representing the total time they have to act during the current turn.
All actions in Tactical mode require Time Units to perform. Once a
soldier is out of Time Units, he or she can't do anything more until the
next turn.</p>
<p>Your mission objectives will vary for each mission, and there are
many to perform as the aliens' terrifying plot unfolds. You'll have to
watch your back, be quick on your feet, and take the fight to them.</p>
<p>If you don't, humanity is doomed.</p></td>

<h2 id="game_engine">Game engine</h2>
<p>The game engine is based on a heavily modified version of id
Software's <em>Quake 2</em> engine. This doesn't mean that <em>UFO:
Alien Invasion</em> is a modification or even a total conversion of
<em>Quake 2</em>. It is a stand-alone game and doesn't require <em>Quake
2</em> or any other program to run. All you need to play <em>UFO:AI</em>
is a computer running Microsoft Windows or a supported version of Linux,
and the installer from our website.</p>
<p>Our updated engine has modern OpenGL graphics and special effects,
increased texture resolution, hardware-accelerated clipping of map
layers for toggling between levels, a new animation system for player
models, powerful artificial intelligence, and many other exciting
features. Is was developed as a joint effort with the <a
href="http://www.quake2world.net/">Quake2World</a> project.</p>

<h2 id="multiplayer">Multiplayer</h2>
<p>You can play <em>UFO: Alien Invasion</em> with your friends via LAN
or Internet connection. One player controls a human team while another
player takes command of the aliens for a bloody head-to-head battle.
<em>UFO:AI</em> also supports cooperative team play with multiple
players on both sides, up to a maximum of 3 teams for each side, 6
players total.</p></td>
