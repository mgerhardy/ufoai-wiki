Maybe we could interrogate aliens on-site? That would add an interesting
factor in gameplay.

Here's how it would work: Imagine an individual alien's brain as a safe
of info, stored by the XVI virus as a sort of shortcut key. Then special
drugs can "tickle" the info out of that safe, to be heard by anyone
caring to listen.

In game play, once some research is made, the workshop can be made to
make "Interrogation" kits. These are used by a soldier on a stunned
alien during combat over a 3-4 turn period. If that soldier or alien
isn't killed during interrogation, then the player will have information
on the next few alien missions displayed on the world map. At first,all
the player can see is the ship type and destination, and errors abound.
As the interrogator's skill increases and the kits get improved, more
info appears, and errors become scarce.
