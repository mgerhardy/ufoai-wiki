Should the discharge also stun mechanical aliens? I like that. Or make
two fire modes, one stun, the other shock (for mechanical). Or make a
separete tazer (electroshock gun), or join a tazer with the 9mm Pistol,
as BTAxis, suggests. This would be cool if shock disables alien weapons
for one turn, as x00q smartly suggests. Then the rod would be useful
even if you don't want aliens alive...
