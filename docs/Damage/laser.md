Beam of focused light that pierces armor and burns flesh inside. So
concentrated are the beams that it's hard to block them with any armor,
especially with armor made by the aliens (it appears they didn't use
laser in their own wars). However the punctures are so minute that armor
is considered almost intact even after lethal shots. Laser weapons tend
to have low damage, long range and high accuracy.
