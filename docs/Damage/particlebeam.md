Extremely high-speed projectile weaponry that can punch through heavy
armor. Delivers damage by transferring the kinetic force of the
projectile to the target. Excellent for high-armour environments.
However, the projectile is moving at such a high speed that it can pass
through a soft target without transferring much of its kinetic force
(ie - it doesn't lose speed). As a result, it will do less damage to an
unarmored target.
