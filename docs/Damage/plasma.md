Plasma damage is dealt with polymer projectiles filled with plasma or
short range bursts of plasma streams. The high-temperature, high-charge
plasma burns all; even advanced armor. Quite effective against humans in
Kevlar Vests and aliens in weak armor. Diffused very well by any medium
and advanced armor, but burns them quickly, nevertheless. Plasma weapons
usually have high damage, short to middle range and mediocre accuracy.
