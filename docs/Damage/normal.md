Normal damage is damage inflicted through impact, solid projectiles or
metal blades. Normal damage usually focuses on applying as large a
Newtonian force on as small an area of the target as possible, causing
the target to rupture at that point. Bullets use this principle, as do
knives. Normal damage also includes a sudden impact, straining the body
and causing it to take damage. In other words, falling from a great
height causes Normal damage.

Normal damage can be defended against by distributing the force of the
impact across a large area. A supple yet firm harness suffices for this
task.
