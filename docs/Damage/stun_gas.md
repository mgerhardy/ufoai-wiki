Stuns biological actors, no effect on mechanical actors and those in
life-support armor. Various methods of stunning are used, for instance,
ultra-high frequency sound waves that temporarily paralyze the nervous
system, injections of very powerful narcotics and drugs, toxic gases of
various kinds.

A stunned biological actor is out for several rounds, but if left alone
for too long, will regain consciousness. This should never take less
than three or four turns.
