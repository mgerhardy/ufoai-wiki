<div style="border:1px solid red; background:#111111; padding:1em;">

A list of **tasks planned for version .**
**Do not commit these things to the trunk yet! Wait until we have a
branch.**
One way to still use [SVN](SVN "wikilink") for these tasks before the
branch is made is to create your own branch (must not conflict with the
release names). Smaller changes can be submitted as
[diffs](diff "wikilink") to the [patch
tracker](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=157793).
