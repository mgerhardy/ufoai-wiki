Overview

The Basic UGV Armour is a simple set of armour plates and reinforcements
meant to extend the combat lifespan of large UGVs. It protects vital
areas and vulnerable joints with plates of super-strong ceramics and
artificial spider silk mesh. Despite its simplicity, however, there is a
lot of speciality engineering going into the armour. Moulding the
ceramic to the contours of the UGV while maintaining their
bullet-stopping strength is a difficult and laborious process, not to
mention expensive.

Like the Ares UGV itself, this armour design is essentially taken
straight from the GEU armoury, with their compliments. Thanks to its
modular designÂ it will bolt straight onto the Ares and any other large
UGV we're likely to build in the future.

Recommended Doctrine

Virtually any UGV that can carry armour should be equipped with one of
these upgrades, regardless of cost. They dramatically enhance UGV
survival rates against projectile weapons, blast damage, and -- to a
lesser extent -- plasma.

Since UGVs are more expensive than armour, the benefits are obvious.

Addenda

None.
