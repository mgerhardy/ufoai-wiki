## Description

Nanocomposite UGV Armour obsoletes Basic Armour. It provides far more
protection with no drawbacks other than a high production time.
Nanocomposites are light, but difficult to mold and the carbon nanotubes
take a long time to produce. On a UGV there isn't much need to mold the
material, and a UGV is far smaller than any aircraft, so that makes it
feasible.

### Battle Implications

Offers more protection to UGVs than Basic Armour.
