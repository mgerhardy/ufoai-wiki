## Description

Alien Plating offers the same trade-off as Heavy Armour. However, Alien
Plating makes Heavy Armour obsolete since it offers the most protection
out of any of the UGV armours. This armour should have more to offer the
Ares than the Phoenix since the Phoenix is made using Alien Materials,
however the Phoenix can still benefit from this as a layer of additional
armour.

### Battle Implications

In combat Alien Plating will provide the UGV with excellent protection.
The UGV will use more TUs to move the same distance verses other armour
types. It could have less of a movement penalty than Heavy Armour or it
could be the same. The number of TUs for firing weapons will remain the
same. Reaction time will also remain the same.

### Research Tree Data

Needed:

- At least one UGV must have received damage and survived
