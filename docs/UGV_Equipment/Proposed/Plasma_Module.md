## Description

<u>Pre-Research Draft Example:</u>

Commander, thanks to the Alien technologies we've incorporated into our
Phoenix UGV, I believe we have the means of arming it with Alien Plasma
weapons. We believe we've learned enough from studying Plasma weapons
that our teams have recovered to disassemble a Plasma Blaster and two
Plasma Pistols, then integrate the components responsible for actually
generating the Plasma discharge into a new UGV module. With this
combination, the new UGV Plasma Module would have the ability to fire a
Plasma Blaster with increased accuracy, and at close range it would have
the option of using a Plasma Thrower discharge as if from two Plasma
Pistols simultaneously.

### Battle Implications

Arms Phoenix UGVs with a Plasma weapon that has the firing modes of the
Plasma Blaster, but is more accurate than the Plasma Blaster, and also
adds a Plasma Thrower mode that works the same was as the Plasma Pistol,
but with twice as much plasma "thrown". This module cannot be used on
Ares UGVs.

Note: The production of a Plasma Module requires the presence of a
Plasma Blaster and two Plasma Pistols at the same base. These items are
destroyed when production begins.
