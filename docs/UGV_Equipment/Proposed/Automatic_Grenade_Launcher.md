## Description

Automatic grenade launcher module provides medium range indirect fire
support. It uses belt-fed standard 25mm grenades for ammunition and
features single-shot, burst or full-auto firing modes. Grenade
launcher's Integrated ballistic computer automatically calculates
trajectory and sets timer for airburst or delayed detonation. Standard
modular mount allows mounting the weapon on most modern armored vehicles
and UGVs.

Trifler: I didn't add this one, but I like the idea. If this is added, I
definitely think it should include Flechette grenades like the ones
available to the soldier-held Grenade Launcher. This way this weapon
could operate like an over-sized shotgun at shorter ranges and fire air
burst grenades at longer distances. The UGV should be capable of having
both loaded simultaneously. Possibly this could be done by having
"Flechette Burst" as a firing mode rather than as an ammunition type to
make things easier.
