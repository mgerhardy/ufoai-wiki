## Description

<u>Pre-Research Draft Example:</u>

Commander, although we do not have a means of producing our own Particle
Beam Cannons, we should be able to design a turret for our UGVs capable
of operating any working Particle Beam Cannon we recover. The recoil
from the Particle Beam Cannon is horrendous, and a UGV is far better
able to handle the forces involved than a soldier. A specially designed
turret also will not be inhibited by the weapon's alien ergonomics. We
can get started at your discretion.

### Battle Implications

Adds the ability to arm UGVs with Particle Beam Cannons. UGVs are able
to fire Particle Beam Cannons more accurately than soldiers due to the
fact that UGVs can better handle the recoil, they don't have to deal
with incorrect ergonomics (per the Particle Beam Cannon text), and the
robotic aiming system.

Note: Since this module is designed as an interface between the weapon
and the UGV, this module must be coded in such a way that it cannot be
added to a UGV if a Particle Beam Cannon is not available in storage at
the same base. If a Particle Beam Cannon is available, add the module to
the UGV and subtract one Particle Beam Cannon from storage. If the
module is later removed, then add one Particle Beam Cannon to base
storage.
