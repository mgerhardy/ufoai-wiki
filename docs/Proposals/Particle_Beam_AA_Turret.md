Constructing a ground-based Particle Beam is a much easier task than
adapting the weapon to an aircraft. The harsh jolts are no longer a
problem and the weapon has access to the base power grid.

As a weapon for assisting our aircraft, this weapon has very limited
range, but in the case of a UFO making a direct attack on our base, it
should prove highly effective.
