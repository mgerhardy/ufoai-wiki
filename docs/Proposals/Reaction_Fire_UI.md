## Description

![](reaction_fire_ui_proposal.jpg "reaction_fire_ui_proposal.jpg") This
is a brief proposal outlining an idea to improve player comprehension of
the reaction fire mechanic. It is a source of constant complaints and
accusations that it is unfair, in spite of the fact that it is one of
the few mechanics in the game in which players and AI are treated
exactly the same.

Because it is such a vital gameplay mechanic, and one which impacts
greatly on players' sense of fairness within the game, we should do more
to communicate precisely how this mechanic works and what is going on.

This proposal suggests the best way to accomplish this is by displaying
the TU relationship between spotter and target *as it happens* during
the opponent's turn. When a target comes into view of a soldier during
the opponent's turn, a panel will pop up showing the soldier and the
target, the soldier's reaction firemode and TU cost, and a small bar
graph showing how many TUs the target has accumulated towards the
reaction fire.

## Notes

- Reaction fire progress panel should only be displayed during the
  opponent's turn. The player should not see his exposure to opponent's
  reaction fire.
- Reaction fire progress panels should only be displayed for the
  currently active target. Otherwise a 12-man team could quickly end up
  with several dozen panels on screen.
