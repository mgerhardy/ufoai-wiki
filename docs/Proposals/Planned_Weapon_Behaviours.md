Several of our weapon research texts included details that could not yet
be implemented. In order to not confuse the player, these texts have
been modified during 2.5's development cycle to more closely match
actual weapon capacity. I have collected the ideas removed here so that
they are not lost and may be implemented some day.

## Laser weapons

- It's impossible for lasers to shoot through clouds of smoke, gas or
  fire.
- Electrolaser:
  - Like all electric weapons, firing at airborne targets will produce
    limited results, unless they're close enough to an earthed object to
    allow the electricity to arc between them.
  - In addition, any electrolaser needs the right kind of atmosphere to
    be able to create a plasma channel; taking them off of Earth could
    render them useless.

## Holographic scope on needler

Instead of an ordinary top-mounted sniper scope, the aliens have
incorporated a highly effective holographic aiming mechanism and
rangefinder which projects directly in front of the user's leading eye.
Targets are shown with absolute clarity at any range, the sight
automatically compensates for natural body motions, and it will even
tell the user the exact chances of scoring a hit at any time. We've run
this thing by our own troops and -- once they got used to it -- the
alien holo-sight was the preferred choice by an amazing 100% compared to
our own scopes. If we can adapt and duplicate this sight in a
self-contained package, we could create the ultimate aiming unit to use
on any of our rifles, possibly even some handguns.

## Electrolaser can't hit aerial targets

Like all electric weapons, firing at airborne targets will produce
limited results, unless they're close enough to an earthed object to
allow the electricity to arc between them. In addition, any electrolaser
needs the right kind of atmosphere to be able to create a plasma
channel; taking them off of Earth could render them useless.
