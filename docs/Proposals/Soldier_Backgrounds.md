I've always enjoyed games where you'd get some detailed background
information - something about the characters whose lives you're
controlling. I imagine that giving a soldier a background would provide
him/her with a much needed personality.

A possible example could be something similar to this:

- Name: Anuresh Narattan

<!-- -->

- Nationality: Middle Eastern

<!-- -->

- Home City: Dubai (now obliterated)

<!-- -->

- Details:

  Anuresh Narattan is one of the rare cases of people who were actually
  fortunate enough to survive the attack on Dubai. As fire rained down
  from the sky, Anuresh found himself surrounded by the maimed bodies of
  his family. Unable to fight the shock of seeing his loved ones
  murdered, he was consumed by frustrated rage. In this mindless state,
  he was picked up by armed forces, who had to knock him out before they
  could tend to his wounds.

  Having witnessed the alien destruction from a first person
  perspective, Anuresh is consumed by a cold, bitter and unlogical
  desire for revenge, which serves as his fuel, but at the expense of
  alienating him from his comrades.

  Anuresh is proficient with a broad range of weapons, but favors small
  arms with scopes.

## Implementation

This proposal would require the following:

- Separate soldier names into different lists to fit their origin.
- Code to link correct background story to a soldier.
- Code to choose soldiers based on nation providing the soldier.
- A minimum of 50 backgrounds to ensure uniqueness. Care should be taken
  to match approximate number of recruits expected from a nation (if it
  gives more soldiers, it should have more backgrounds).
