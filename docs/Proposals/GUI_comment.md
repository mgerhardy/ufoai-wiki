This document comment some 2.2.1 GUI to provide some proposal GUI. The
only objective is the usability, i am not a good designer, and if i
change some design, its only to create preview faster (with my hands).

This document is not about design, someone have another proposal for
that. But, to be clear, i dont specially love the 2.2.1 "metal and
green", because, here, to have a good roleplay GUI, maybe the only thing
to do is to create something look like an OS (an a little futuristic if
possible). The commander do not have in front of him a metallic system
with green LCD screens. We can think he manage everything in front of
his computer... like the player. I will not talk more about design :)

This document is a draft, help and comment are welcome. And i dont have
a very good english, i hope if its not understandable, its at least
readable.
