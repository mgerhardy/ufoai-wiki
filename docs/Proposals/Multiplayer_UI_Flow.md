The following is an outline for improving the multiplayer UI flow. It is
designed to work with the existing multiplayer system (as of 2.4) with a
few additional checks/changes for 2.5. It is based on the assumption
that a few features, like equipment selection, won't be implemented.

Two things -- the check on whether a saved team exists and the branch
that allows the player to select a sub-set of soldiers if the server
supports less than 8 soldiers -- are designed to help new players who
may not know what needs to be set up or that some servers may not allow
all of their soldiers
