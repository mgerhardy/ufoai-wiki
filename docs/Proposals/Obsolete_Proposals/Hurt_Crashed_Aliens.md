Imagine you are an alien sitting in a UFO which has just been shot by an
angry Phalanx vessel. Chances are good that you break a leg, an arm or
get a scratched while hitting the ground. :)

This proposal asks for a mechanism that inflicts some damage to the crew
of a crashed UFO. It might also be nice to make the amount of damage
being done dependent on the duration between the crash and the time the
Phalanx troop arrives (longer duration -\> less damage). This would make
the player go after the UFO quickly and not wait another 12h in order to
fight in daylight. It would also make missions with landed UFOs slightly
more dangerous than missions with crashed UFOs.

Additionally this mechanism can provide another (fine-grained) knob to
configure the difficulty levels.
