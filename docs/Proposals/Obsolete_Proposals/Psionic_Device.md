Does anyone know the status of this? We've got alien bases and the
device appears in the base. Is it collected? Can it be researched?

Sir, our troops just got back from our raid on the alien base. They
brought back the wreckage of that strange device we encountered. I need
this wreckage turned over to DivIntel immediately, as well as some
funding and lab time, so that we can find out its purpose and try to
unravel the mystery of the powerful psionic attacks which emanated from
it during the attack.

The device has to be of extreme importance for the entire base to be
built around it. But is it a weapon, a computer, a communication device,
or something more mysterious? If more alien bases are found, we may have
to defend ourselves from other such devices, although I sincerely hope
that's not the case.

Cdr. Navarre and Dr. Connor have already committed their support for the
project, and both have agreed to assist us with the technical side of
research. All we need now is your approval, Commander.

With kind regards, Col. Falkland
