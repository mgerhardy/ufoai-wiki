I was thinking about ShipIt's comment about how there should be more
reverse engineering for weapons rather than just using alien weapons.

What about this premise for a new ammo:

Since the aliens use plasma a lot, they have also developed their armour
to be good against it. The armour is primarily effective because it
melts slowly under heat. Since plasma disintegrates quickly, it is able
to withstand the momentary heat with little damage.

Phalanx scientists develop a miniaturized shape charge that fits into a
rifle's bullet size. This round has a small plasma core, a tip that
fragments on impact and a soft outer casing. When the bullet hits a hard
target (alien armour), the tip fragments and the small plasma core slams
into the armour. The soft outer casing forms a sealed shell around the
plasma core, trapping the heat so that it burns through the armour and
thereby delivering the full force of the plasma's heat onto the target.

This weapon could be more effective against armoured aliens than a
regular plasma rifle, but slightly less effective against unarmoured
aliens, because the actual amount of plasma is much smaller. The only
difference is that with this round, it is actually penetrating the
armour more.

This would make deploying the plasma rifle for phalanx less effective
immediately (so they are at a disadvantage longer). The new ammo could
require that a plasma weapon and alien armour be researched, putting a
longer research trajectory in front of it that means the player does not
get the full plasma benefits right away. And it could also provide a
mid-game relevance to the assault and sniper rifles.

This proposal would require the following changes to other aspects of
the game:

- Alien Armour rebalanced to be effective against plasma
- Figure out some mechanism for this weapon to work better (right now we
  only have _light, _normal, _heavy for plasma, maybe we need
  something else).
- Alien Armour tech write-ups adjusted

Weapons available/not available:

- Pistols: no. caliber is too small to house the plasma core
- Assault rifles: yes
- Machine Gun: yes
- SMG: no. caliber too small
- Shotguns: no. need directional projectile for collapsable tip to work.
- Sniper Rifle: yes.

Research Prerequisites:

- [Alien Armour](Translation:Alien_body_armour_txt/en "wikilink")
- [Plasma and the Grenade
  Launcher](Translation:Grenl_plasma_ammo_txt/en "wikilink")
- OR: all plasma weapons (grenade, pistol, rifle, blaster) to delay it's
  in-game time?
