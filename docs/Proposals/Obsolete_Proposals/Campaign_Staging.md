The following is an attempt to outline the campaign progression we
envision, including proposed but not implemented items. It will list
broad benchmarks in the campaign's timeline and the relationship between
the game's content (weapons, aircraft, aliens, UFOs) and its storyline
(major story events). Because the player controls his own research and
events in the game are not always entirely predictable, this page is
meant only as a rough guide to help us balance research and disassembly
times, equipment costs, the timing of new UFO and alien appearances,
etc.

The outline below attempts to organize the campaign in three basic
stages. First, the player begins to learn about what the aliens are.
Second, the player discovers XVI and races to stop its spread. Third,
the aliens recognize their XVI efforts are being thwarted and open up a
more destructive phase of the battle.

Timing is based on standard difficulty, with alien interest increasing 1
every 22 hours. Alien interest begins the game at 20. Average UFOs shows
the total during the stage, a monthly rate, and an average "per cycle"
rate, which is based on an 8-day cycle defined in the code. Note that in
each cycle the actual number of UFOs can fluctuate quite a bit.

*2012-10-29* -- UFO frequency was reduced in master, but the Average UFO
values below have not been updated to reflect this.
