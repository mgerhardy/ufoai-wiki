## Synopsis

*Terror From the Deep*, the sequel to *Enemy Unknown*, possessed several
novel features in an ocean/underwater setting. This proposal amounts to
extending *UFO:AI* to include similar features.

Possible extensions include:

1.  Deep-sea bases (either under water or on surface platforms).
2.  Submarines/ships.
3.  Submarine bays (in addition to or instead of aircraft hangar bays).
4.  Underwater battles.
5.  Retrieval of UFOs that crash into the sea.
6.  Underwater equipment/technologies.
7.  Aquatic alien species.
8.  Vertical movement modes to reflect neutral buoyancy.

## Conclusion

The proposal has been rejected within the main program fork. However,
unofficial game modifications to this end are possible and are
encouraged.
