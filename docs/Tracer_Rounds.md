`Tracer Rounds can be used at night-time to briefly illuminate what the soldier is shooting at.`

They have two benefits: 1. They show the shooter what they are aiming
at, when at night-time, they may not be able to see the end of their
sights (don't give off IR: goggles won't work). 2. They mark the target
so the other troopers in the squad can briefly 'see' the alien and can
shoot at it for that round only.
