A [dissertation](http://www.bestdissertation.com/) or thesis is a
document submitted in support of candidature for a degree or
professional qualification presenting the author's research and
findings. In some countries/universities, the word thesis or a cognate
is used as part of a bachelor's or master's course, while dissertation
is normally applied to a doctorate. The term "dissertation" can also
mean, more in general, a treatise on some subject, without relation to
obtaining an academic degree. The term "thesis" can also mean the
central claim of an essay or similar work.
