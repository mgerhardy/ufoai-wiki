@Winter: Would you mind explaining to me what 'exactly' these
requirements

     1 Particle beam weapon
     UFO -- Fighter, OR
     UFO -- Harvester

mean?

Is this weapon researchable when

    item-beamweapon
    OR
    tech-Fighter
    OR
    tech-Harvester

or is it researchable when


    item-beamweapon
    AND
    (
      tech-Fighter
      OR
      tech-Harvester
    )

(OR=logical "or", not the exclusive or) I suspect the first one, but I
just want to get sure this is done correctly in the research tree.

No, it's the second one, not the first one. You can tell because I've
not put an OR tag after "1 Particle beam weapon". Do we have correct
code support for this? We really should, because I've run into this
situation more than once during the storyline writeup.

Ok. Currently we can't do it ... i.e no AND and OR mixing as is required
*here*, only a few situations (as we discussed some time ago) can be
solved yet - the text about `requires_OR` and `requires_AND` in the
shows how it currently works.

I'm currently working on a solution - if I change the code a little we
can create more complex requirements by building dummy-techs (only used
this - will not be displayed anywhere) in between. It's the only sane
solution i can see right now. --[Hoehrer](User:Hoehrer "wikilink")
