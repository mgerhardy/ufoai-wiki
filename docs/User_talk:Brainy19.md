Hi Brainy19, while we appreciate the work you put into writing new pages
for the story/research tree could you please contact our story guy
[Winter](user:Winter "wikilink") before doing so? *Nothing* get's added
to the story/descriptions without being checked by him first. So most of
your stuff will most likely be removed/overwriteen if you don't do that.
It'll spare all of us time and work :)

Sorry about that, I'll do so for now on.
