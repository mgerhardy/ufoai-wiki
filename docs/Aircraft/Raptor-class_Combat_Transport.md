This is a placeholder page, pending a proper writeup. Some factoids
about this craft:

- This is the last dropship, available in the late game. It is a solid
  allround craft, adept at carrying troops quickly to the battlefield
  and engaging UFOs. However, though versatile and powerful, it is
  outperformed at everything it does by other craft that specialise in
  the relevant role.
  - Is it going to be fully spaceworthy and FTL capable for the ultimate
    mission?
- We have model for this craft, and there are RMAs with it.
- This craft makes use of alien technology.
- Capacity: 10 soldiers, 1 UGV (up to 3 with hardpoint pods)
