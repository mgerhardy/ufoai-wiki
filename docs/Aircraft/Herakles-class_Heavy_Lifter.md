This is a placeholder page, pending a proper writeup. Some factoids
about this craft:

- This craft is a large troop transport. It can carry more troops and is
  faster than the
  [Firebird](Aircraft/Firebird-class_Dropship "wikilink"), but is poorly
  armed compared to most other PHALANX craft.
- We have a model for this craft. See and
- This craft makes use of alien technology.
  - Which technologies?
    - I put it down to Alien Aircraft Plating for now. The model doesn't
      look like it uses alien engines and I can't imagine what else it
      would need. --[BTAxis](User:BTAxis "wikilink") 15:43, 20 December

    - I have a few ideas:
      - How about Alien Materials so that it will change shape in air?
        E.g. using electric current, it allows to extend the wings to a
        larger area, but making the craft too cumbersome for
        manoeuvering. The wings would have to be retracted after landing
        for storage. The downside of that is Alien Materials are
        suggested to be heavy, so the idea might fall flat.
      - Another idea is using Antimatter for power (the craft has a low
        lift generating area, so having access to far greater power than
        standard petrol might be viable).
      - Yet another idea is using Alien Computers because of enormous
        amount of data required for flying a heavy aircraft with
        vectored thrust.
- Capacity: 12 soldiers, 2 UGVs (3 with hardpoint pod)
