This is a placeholder page, pending a proper writeup. Some factoids
about this craft:

- The craft is a middle ground between an interceptor and a dropship. It
  can carry fewer troops than the Firebird, but has much better odds of
  surviving an encounter with a UFO, and is suited to assist in bringing
  one down.

<!-- -->

- This craft becomes available in the early game, after research. It is
  entirely human-tech based.
- There are three candidates for models in our forums, but none at a
  sufficient stage of completion.
