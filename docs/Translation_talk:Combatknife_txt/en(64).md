Like Pistols, knives may be used ambidextrously (is it true? twice
damage in melee? I saw only "pistol" in the code... and this would
require rebalancing... --[Bandobras](User:Bandobras "wikilink")).

Multifunctional high-grade carbon steel blade. Can be used for anything
from cutting ropes to carving up an alien when you run out of ammo.

Nice text. But are there any ropes in UFO:AI? Is there any use for the
knife, other than stab at an alien? If not, I would opt for some more
aggresive description (and higher stab damage or quicker stabs), e.g.
inspired by Renaissance stilletos designed to bypass armor. I would also
like to change name to someting less bland. I changed it to Combat
Knife, which suggests a bigger knife, e.g. 7 inches. Is it OK with you?

Any chance we can get it painted black and add a jagged edge to make it
look more convincing? And even if there aren't any ropes in game I
wouldn't be against mentioning the prowess said knife might have at it.
There's nothing wrong with adding some fun realism and depth to the
story. Even mentioning how efficient a knife may be for butchering small
woodland animals in the event of being stranded could be construed as
all in good fun ;D.--[ASA-IRULE](User:ASA-IRULE "wikilink") 08:50, 5
