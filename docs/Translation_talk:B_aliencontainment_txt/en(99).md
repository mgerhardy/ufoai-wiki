**Reenen**: Should the filing date be 1958, not 2058? If it is, the word
"PHALANX" should not appear in the actual document.

But I like the writing style etc. of it.


The filing date **is** 1958. If you mean it should be 2058, then no, I'm
afraid you're somehow mistaken or have been misled by unofficial
material. The official storyline puts PHALANX's conception and formation
in 1955 and 1957, respectively, and its dissolution in 2027.
