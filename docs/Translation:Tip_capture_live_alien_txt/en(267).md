## Memo

**TO:** Base Commander, PHALANX, Atlantic Operations Command

**FROM:** Dr. Connor, R&D: Bio & Containment Division, PHALANX, Atlantic
Operations Command

**SUB:** Memo: Live Aliens

Commander,

We need to capture some aliens alive if we're ever going to understand
our enemy. We can learn a lot from performing an autopsy on alien
corpses, but to figure out how these creatures tick we need to observe
live specimens.

If you can stun aliens on the battlefield and bring them in alive to a
base with an alien containment facility, there's no telling what we
could accomplish. We can see better how their biological organisms
function and probe them for weaknesses. In time we might even be able to
develop a way to communicate with them.

I know it's a great risk to your soldiers to capture them alive, sir,
but it's a risk we'll have to take if we're ever going to win this war.

Sincerely,

Dr. Connor
