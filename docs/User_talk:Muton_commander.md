#### Get rid of UFO's attacking nearby ships

Please remove this feature. This game is supposed to be an X-COM
tribute, and X-COM never had this except for Apocalypse (and it was only
one city, so UFO's had birds' eye view of the ships). This really
unbalances the game, especially if you have the misfortune of
encountering the larger UFO's en route to your first terror site. [Muton

#### Another Thing

Why do you stray so far from what made X-COM X-COM? You removed in game
saves, controlled air combat, super missions, et cetera (actually some
of these could be understood if they lasted until about the second
version, but come on! It's almost version 2.3!). If you do not like how
we gripe about the game, then it's your fault, because this is an **open
source** game! You let the people influence the game.

## this is not xcom

This game is called "UFO Alien Invasion".

And if you want to play in X-Com, go on, install X-Com EU, or X-Com
Tftd, and play that games.

And yes, this is open source, so you may use it, uninstall it or code it
yourself. But don\`t command to developers.
