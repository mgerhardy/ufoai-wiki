## Translation

Hi. Thanks for your fix. If you are interested by translation, i create
this page [List of msgid/es](List_of_msgid/es "wikilink").

Hi. I also dont think we should translate content outside "Translation:"
namespace. Content outside "Translation:" is not for the game, and can
change a lot, i dont think we have resources to manage translation for
the full wiki. [Bayo](User:Bayo "wikilink") 12:39, 15 October 2010

I talk about [Da침o/l치ser](Da침o/l치ser "wikilink"). If you really want to
translate it, i can do some improvment but the name page must be
[Damage/laser/es](Damage/laser/es "wikilink").

Yeah maybe I should hold on translating damage/skill descriptions unless
they will be included ingame. --[DarkRain](User:DarkRain "wikilink")
