## Android port

We are glad to announce the port of UFO:AI in Android platform. It is
still in alpha development, but the current status looks playable.

The game use the framework by pelya, and we thank him for all his work
on the .

Idea is mostly to support ARM processor, and OpenGL ES rendering. The
game will be really playable on a phone with an incredible amount of
work - we can't do it. But we can improve a little the usability of the
game on this kind of touch screen platform, so it will be playable on a
tablet-type devices.

The game requires vast amount of RAM to run - 150 MB just to start
single-player, and 320 MB to load smallest skirmish map (training_a or
africa_small). We can confirm it runs on HTC Evo and Folio 100 devices,
and does not run on Samsung Spica.

You may (2 MB). The game will automatically download data (100 MB) to SD
card on the first run, all textures have been deliberately downscaled to
save space, it contains only 6 skirmish maps and no sounds, but you can
download all other maps and sounds package by selecting "Additional
downloads" from SDL config menu. Also it's advised to go to "Mouse
emulation"-\>"Calibrate touchscreen", because you will need to hit the
screen edge to scroll the map.

You can follow the progress on .
