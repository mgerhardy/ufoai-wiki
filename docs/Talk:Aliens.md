The alien descriptions are just copied from the origian design docs -
they will most likely require a rewrite depending on how work on the
storyline progresses.

## Capture details

There ought to be a section, somewhere, about how to capture aliens. I
know there is documentation on capturing alien equipment, such as ufo's,
and nets, but I haven't been able to find out how to capture aliens
themselves.
