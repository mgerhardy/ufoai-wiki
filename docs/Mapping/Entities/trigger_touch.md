## General

Any entity that touches this will trigger the use function of the target
entity.

## Keys

- **target**: target entity (must have its targetname set to the value
  given here)

## Special

In order to trigger more than one entity, those must be part of the same
group. This way e.g. it is possible to switch several cameras on/off.
This is **not** [func_group](func_group "wikilink") related - use the
**group** property of the entities that support it.
