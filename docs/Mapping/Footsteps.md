## General

Since version 1.2.1 ufo2map is generating a footsteps file. This file
includes all the textures which faces were marked with the
[surfaceflag](Mapping/Surface_inspector#Surface_flags "wikilink")
footstep. These textures can be merged with into .

These soundfiles are played when an actor walks over a texture with a
terrain entry. This file is global, so all maps are affected by it. So
set the footstep flag wisely.
