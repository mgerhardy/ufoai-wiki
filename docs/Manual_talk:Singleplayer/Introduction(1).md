## My 2c on the introduction text for singleplayer

**1. the story**

The Storyline Introduction (we could call it "Preamble" or something
similar) should feature a condensed version of the events that lead up
to the beginning of the game (See
[Storyline/Final#.22Introduction.22](Storyline/Final#.22Introduction.22 "wikilink"),
but do not stop there :))

**2. The first instructions**

A very cleanly written guide on the first steps after the game has
started. If we ever get real interactive in-game tutorials to work this
should be exactly the same :) In the case of this text i think a mixture
of the text provided here
[Storyline/Final#.22First_instructions.22](Storyline/Final#.22First_instructions.22 "wikilink")
and a step by step guide with images/screenshots should work well.

Provide references to the related chapters in the manual (especially
links with the full name of the chapter) and screenshots of the various
steps.

**A final note**: I do not think separate pages (as the current
structure implies) for the two chapters are needed, but if it gets to
long/much we can still split it up.
