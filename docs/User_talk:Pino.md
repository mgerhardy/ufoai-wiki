Hi Pino, I'm sorry to tell you that i had to roll back a change you made
to [List_of_msgid/Equipment](List_of_msgid/Equipment "wikilink")
recently. It messed up the entries for the other languages (including
the links). See more here:
[Talk:List_of_msgid/Equipment](Talk:List_of_msgid/Equipment "wikilink").
Any solution to that problem would be appreciated.
