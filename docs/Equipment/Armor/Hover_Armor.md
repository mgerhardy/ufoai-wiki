## Official Description

### Battle Implications

An armor built with thinner layers of armor fabric than Heavy Nano
Armor, but with many technological improvements that make it almost as
impenetrable, while only moderately less durable. The lower bulk enables
the addition of small jet engines that allow the soldier to float for
short periods of time. The armor cannot sustain flight for very long,
and any soldier who ends his turn in the air will fall to the ground.
