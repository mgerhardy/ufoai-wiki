## Official Description

### Battle Implications

A modified Nano Armor that offers good protection against psionic
attacks. It also offers a bonus to a soldier's psionic abilities.
Electromagnetic dissipator built in an armor, reliably protects the
fighter from plasma shots, and the heavy ceramic coating provides
additional resistance against thermal effects of a shot. A reduced
version of the tachyon particle screen was also installed, adding to the
armor weight.
