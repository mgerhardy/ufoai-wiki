## Description

The tachyon ammo for RPG-37 is a definite human advantage over aliens in
this devastating war. We are now convinced the only alien weapon with an
explosive Tachyon effect is the Tachyon Rifle, and only in its primary
attack mode. Our forces are now armed with a tachyon explosive weapon
unavailable to the aliens: the Tachyon-Beam Rocket. It is a formidable
projectile, propelled using the usual liquid fuel engines, emanating
high-power tachyon radiation upon impact.

### Battle Implications

The most advanced of all rockets, the Tachyon-Beam Rocket has a somewhat
smaller splash damage radius than High-Explosive Rocket, but the same
long range. After reaching its target, the warhead powers off its
miniaturized particle accelerator where the tachyon particles are
stored. The particles beam in all directions and the warhead is consumed
by the ensuing storm of tachyon particle explosions.
