## UN-Official Description

Self-defence weapon, not very powerful or fast-shooting, but good for
driving away burglars. Many people on Earth have it, especially in
North, South America and Africa, because of the past.

### Battle Implications

Sometimes civilians in fear try to shoot 'hideous monsters'. But because
of lack of skill and 'push' in their weaponry they usually end as a
toast. Bloody toast.
