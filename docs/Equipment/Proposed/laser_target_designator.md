Laser target designators have been an integral tool in an elite soldiers
arsenal sense the latter half of the 20'th century. This Lockheed Martin
hand held target designator utilizes the latest advances in
miniaturization have allowed it to be hand held and posses a range over
10 miles. Advances in computing power have allowed this target
designator to become the standard designator for all laser guided
munitions. Frequency hopping and variable timing on the laser pulses
allow this to system to be unjammable. Following the formation of
PHALANX the U.S. army revealed a secondary function which sends an
infrared pulse which tags a target with a distinct geometric pattern
which can be detected for 1 minuet by thermal imaging, which eliminate
the need for the operator to continually paint the target. It has long
been rumored that the US millitary also uses this device to blind enemy
soldiers by dazzling the eye of enemy soldiers.
