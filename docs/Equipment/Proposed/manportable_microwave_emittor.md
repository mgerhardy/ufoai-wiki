The U.S. millitary first used the area denial system to supress large
groups of people with a less than lethal approach. It was noted be army
soldiers that via the photo electric effect the area denial system was
able to disable enemy ieds. This effect was optomised for use against
enemy armor and naturally enemy soldiers. Advances in minaturization
allowed U.S. and in a more primative form Russian forces to field
micowave based weapons. Due to the U.N. Ban on microwave weapons these
weapons were kept secret however with the prospect of an alien invasion
they arent really objecting too much.

effects

against biological targets, this weapon will inflict massive damage to
an unarmored target, especially against targets with large fluid spaces
and gaps between organs. The differential heating could cause the target
organs to collapse and suffer damage akin to radiation burns. Pulsed
opperation would be lethal and possiby cause the target to 'pop'

against robots it will cause electrons to jump and short out elecronics
resulting in a soft kill.

low power continuious- will cause enemy soldiers to experience a burning
sensation and loose conciousness form continuious exposure. high power
continuious- will burn enemy soldiers and cook them from the inside out
high power pulse-will cause massive mechanical and burn damage

Any aliens killed this way will yield little to no research value.
