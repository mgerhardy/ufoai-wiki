This is a small camera with an image processor and an radio transmitter
attached to it. It can be dropped on the battlefield to monitor
strategically important positions without the need to leave an soldier
behind. These cameras are small, hard to spott and easy to destroy or
take away. As they are very similar to other technical stuff that is
found in inhabitate areas most aliens won't notice their purpose. But to
be sure the camera does only send an image if there is "something
iteresting to see" (moving persons).

There also in an reciever that has to be held in one hand. It only shows
the number of person seen. The soldier needs 15 tus per camera to
actually look at it. As the cameras are cheap and the reciever can
handle up to 10 cameras the team will take several or none with them.
