This is the modern cousin of the Claymore.

## Battle Implications

This is a mine that deals damage only in 30 to 45 degree angle. The
facing is determined, when the mine is set up. It is used to

- defend semi-permanent positions, for example sniper positions ,
  against close assaults
- protect against circling, flanking and attacks in the rear
- prepare ambushes and traps

Fire modes

- tripwire activated
  - This takes at least one full round to set up, probable one round
    plus set number of TU for each field the tripwire covers. The
    tripwire must be a straight line between two objects and is hidden
    like the mine after deployment. There should be a length limit for
    the tripwire.
  - Anyone stepping on a field with the tripwire will detonate the
    directional mine. That include friendlies and civilians.
  - The tripwire does not need to face the same direction as the mine,
    but one end must be connected to the mine.
- manually activated
  - Setting up has a high TU cost.
  - The mine is linked to a detonator. Multiple mines can be linked to
    the same detonator.
  - The mine goes off, if and only if a Soldier uses the linked
    detonator.
