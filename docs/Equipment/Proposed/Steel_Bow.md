## UN-Official Description

Human hunters from ancient times used a bow - first missile weapon. Now
this weapon is used by special forces around the world. It's main
because of stealth and possibility to fold and use less place. Besides
that many types of futuristic armor aren't created to stop this type of
missile.

### Battle Implications

It's very good weapon-of-choice for those, who like to go stealthy on
missions (especially if, humans could adapt alien cloaker). Next plus of
this weapon is absolutely silent. It can shoot normal (iron or alien
metal/plastic) bolts, explosive bolts and flare bolts (which, even if
they don't kill target, made it very visible - and easy to hit for other
teammates).
