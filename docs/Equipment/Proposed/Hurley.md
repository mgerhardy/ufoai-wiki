## Description

A hurley is the stick used in the Irish national sport of hurling, as
well as in the Scottish equivalent shinty. It is a heavy ashwood stick
with an axe-like head with a metal band on it. Hurling is itself a truly
ancient sport, and the stick used in play to hit the small ball, the
sliotar, has changed little. While both games are, as such, most popular
in Ireland and Britain, Irish immigrants, and later the Gaelic Athletic
Association exported it to North America, as well as parts of South
America such as Argentina, South Africa, and Australia and New Zealand.

### Battle Implications

A hurley is a large, heavy piece of shaped ashwood. If a man is struck
with a hurley well, it may well break a bone. Accidental deaths in games
have even been reported in earlier centuries, though with the
standardization of the game it became less of a problem. All the same,
it may have value if intentionally used to kill something, though the
actual effectiveness against a resisting target is dubious if they're
remotely prepared, as the awkward shape of the stick would make it
awkward to use swiftly unless it was held in two hands for the purpose
of a fight.
