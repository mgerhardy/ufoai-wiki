This is the long rumored Man portable acustic device, which sends
concentrated coherant sound waves in the direction of the target. This
was initially developed as the LRAD which was mounted on the vehicle but
was quickly adaped by DARPA and Phalanx as a man portable weapon
resembling a large rifle. This device emitts a continuious stream of
sound over long distances to deliver 120 db of sounds to the target. A
250 db high amplitude pulse is the secondary mode of this weapon. While
both are theoretically "non lethal" the 250 db pulse can cause
vibrations in the body cavity and internal hemoraging especially when
aimed at the head.

battle implications
