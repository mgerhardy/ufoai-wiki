The (Chemical) Agent Delivery System is an outgrowth of tranquilizer and
paint ball gun technologies. Originally developed as a less than lethal
weapon for police forces, it has found its way into many an armory for
its versatility. It fires a slow moving, big caliber projectile that
bursts at impact and releases its contents on the target. Typical
payloads are acids, short lived poisons(contact or gaseous), self
igniting incendiary agents(white phosphor/napalm derivations) and
marking substances. The projectile itself has no penetration depth even
against unarmored targets. It is commonly used in highly populated
areas, where the use of grenades and rockets with similar payloads is
inadvisable due to risk of civilian casualties.

## Battle Implications

This weapon allows accurate delivery of specialized payloads over short
to medium distances. Handling times comparable to the riot shotgun. 21
to 30 rounds per magazine. Effective range is about pistol/SMG range
depending on the payload.

Fire modes:

- single
- auto(3 rounds)

The ADS is available from the start, but initial payloads are of limited
use. Research, especially autopsies and armor analysis, will yield more
effective munitions.

## Damage Type
