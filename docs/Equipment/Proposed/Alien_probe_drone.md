This device can be deployed by some aliens and controlled by their mind
(mostly alien commanders) to search and destroy purpose.

The device hovers through the battlefield and search the vicinity for
human targets. When a target is located, the probe informs it´s pilot,
who has several options:

1\. activate the drone´s weapon (small plasma weapon - about the same
power as a plasma pistol, it can fire snap shots or rounds of 3-5 shots
with better accuracy as a foot soldier) 2. self destruct the probe,
inflicting great damage in a wide area around itself (overloading of the
propulsion unit)

The probe can be attacked by the player with the chance-to-hit reduced
by the size of the probe. The probe moves fast (around 60-80 TU´s) and
its UI is very high (the same level as the pilot), it seeks cover on the
battlefield to reduce the chance of beeing destroyed.

Carrying of each probe requires full backpack capacity.

This tech can be copied and used by human troops (via remote, that
enables the soldier to control the probe). It has a significant drawback
though, as it uses antimatter as propulsion, so it should be used
carefully.
