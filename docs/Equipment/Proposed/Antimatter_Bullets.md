## Official Description

When the antimatter in the bullet gets into contact with the flesh of
the target, the matter of the flesh gets neutralized from the antimatter
atoms which releases an immense amount of energy. This ultimately, turns
the target into a bomb, damaging the enemies surrounding it. The target
itself will die from the explosion, this is like shooting a grenade in
the form of a bullet; only more powerful.

### Battle Implications

The target immediately dies(no matter how tough) and anyone, enemy or
friendly, will at least receive damage if they haven't died from the
blast yet.

### Damage Type

Explosive

### Skill

None required.

### Speciality
