*[Grey goo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_goo)* consists of a load
of nano disassemblers used as ammo. The delivery system can be
projectiles
([AGS](Equipment/Proposed/Agent_Delivery_System(AGS) "wikilink")),
grenades, mines, or even manual placement. The disassemblers are
programmed to gobble up specific molecules (alien flesh, alien armor
etc.) Ideally the weapon would persist on the terrain and maybe even
spread (like fire, but slower).

Of course this might also be conceived as an alien weapon instead.
