# Description

The cloaking device renders an alien invisible on sight and also for
most equipment. It uses the principe of bending the light and so makes
the unit invisible by naked eye. IR googles can detect some shadows
moving throught the battlefield, that enables the soldier equiped with
IR googles to shoot the cloaked enemy, but at great accuracy penalty.
The cloaked unit can be detected with advanced IR sights, developed from
the IR googles. The cloaking device is large piece of equipment and
consumes full backpack capacity.

# Battle Implications

The device can be used only for a limited perod of time, as the energy
drain would be very high (3-4 turns). There is an on/off switch, that
allows the cloak to operate for shorter time periods. After this time
the device is useless and cannot be used until recharge at the base.

The device is ideal for stealth tactics - sneaking into the position of
human player and inflicting great damage by placing proximity mines,
attacking a soldier with a kerrblade, suicidal attacks with an alien
detonator etc., or to move undetected on the battlefield
