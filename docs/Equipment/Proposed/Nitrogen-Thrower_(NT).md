## Official Description

[flamethrower](Equipment/Primary_Weapons/Flamethrower "wikilink"), that
showers the target with a directed liquid nitrogen stream, causing faint
in the alien, stuning it.

### Battle Implications

Similar in use to a flamethrower, it has less distructive effects on the
surrounding enviroment (it doesn't set things on fire) but is very
effective on living targets and in some cases it completely disables
automated systems. It is a long-shot stun weapon.
