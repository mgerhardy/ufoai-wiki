## Official Description

Jump Pack is a practical tool for soldiers that allows them to jump up
or down around 3 meters (one storey) or to jump over obstacles on the
battle field. It propels the soldier with help of a concentrated gas
burst from the Jump Pack. Unfortunately it uses a special mixture of
gases that can be compressed to much higher density than air making it
usable only 2 times until refilled only in laboratory. Another
disadvantage is that it uses whole backpack space and because of its
weight is makes the person little more clumsy and slows him down
significantly. As this tool uses a burst of gas it does not allow any
movement coordination and will slightly propel the owner in direction
where he is heading. It's usage is very easy and therefore does not
require any special training.

Further research can improve this device to a much more sophisticated
device that will allow hovering over ground in much higher levels as
well as maneuvering.

**Battle Implications**

Jump Pack is ideal for soldiers that need to get on or jump down quickly
from roofs or when they need to pass obstacles. Both snipers and close
combat units can benefit significantly from JumpPack as they can take
their strategic positions much faster. For safety reasons it is equipped
with a sensor disallowing it's usage in closed spaces. When depleted,
soldier can drop it on the floor and collect it after the battle. This
will bring back soldiers full movement capabilities.
