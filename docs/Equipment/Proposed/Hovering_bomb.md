## UN-Official Description

From first, XX-century warfare experiments evolved weapon which design
was to save human life. Somehow similar to UGV it's sole purpose was...
'blow things to hell'. Shape of this, feared on many battlefields,
weapon is very simple. It's just mini-copter with atomic engine, few
cameras, radio, and small exploding cargo. Machine is cheap and small,
every soldier can carry one, deploy it and 'drive' as the need appears.
Inside cargo bay may be many explosive loads - fire, explosives and,
when researched - plasma.

### Battle Implications

The greatness of appearance this invention is obvious. Soldier life is
very precious - a machine is just a bunch of metal. However this weapons
hasn't got just advantages. It's cameras can distinguish only moving
targets - but both humans and aliens looks to it the same. Moreover,
little tank has fuel just for few seconds of flight. And the least
disadvantage - it can be destroyed or damaged with just one hit.
