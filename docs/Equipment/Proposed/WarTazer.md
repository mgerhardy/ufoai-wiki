## UN-Official Description

For purpose of capturing the aliens human mind created something
sophisticated. Although normal 'taser' weapons couldn't do a scratch,
scientist created something with more 'kick'. In electroweapons family
were two main disadvantages - short range and low electricity output. In
this type of weapon scientists approached the subject on other way.
WarTazer looks like ordinary pistol with large magazine (which contains
up to five bolts). Each bolt is, in fact, miniaturized machine, which,
when flying to target, opens it's hooks, and digs itsef into target.
Then to work comes engine INSIDE the bolt, which products enormous
energy... for 0,5 second. From WarTazer we can shoot about on 40 meters.

### Battle Implications

This weapon is created for disabling mechanical and organic enemies.
Completely new design is very expensive and difficult in reloading, but
that's the best, what can be done. Good thing is that five bolts in
magazine are sufficient to disable even the toughest aliens. The main
drawback is that WarTazer is very heavy weapon and even ammo clips are
pretty large. Soldier which shoots this kind of weapon must have great
strength and iron will.
