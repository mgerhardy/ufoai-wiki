## Official Description

A modernized version of a weapon known for over 2000 years, hunting bows
use tension to drive a pointed projectile at lethal speeds.

### Battle Implications

Since modern archery equipment has been repeatedly used to kill some of
the largest land animals on the planet, it would be reasonable to assume
that aliens would also be vulnerable. A bow-user wise enough to aim for
an alien's head could well score a kill, and would not have barrel flash
to reveal his or her position.

The main two *draw*backs are size and range. Even a 60' bow would not be
well suited for use in tight spaces. Also, the weapon's usefulness
depends entirely on the physical strength of the wielder - an archer who
could hit a skull-sized target at 100 yards would be considered a very
good bowman.(a modern day longbow can launch an arrow up to 200 yards)

While clearly inferior to a military sniper rifle or even a
civilian-grade hunting rifle, a good hunting bow could score an
interesting trophy for its user. But for the average civilian, living
long enough to *mount* their trophy would be just as risky.

### Damage Type

- [normal](Damage/normal "wikilink")

### Skill

- [sniper](Skills/sniper "wikilink") (maybe sniper and **heavy** skills?
  speaking from experience, a hunting bow takes serious arm strength to
  use!)

### Additional suggestions

Obviously a two-handed weapon.

Weapon should have one firing mode which takes up nearly all of the
user's available TUs.

If possible, include code for diminishing damage potential as range
increases.
