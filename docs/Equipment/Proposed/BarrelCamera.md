In fact two small cameras attached to the end of a guns barrel looking
left and right. In combination with an small monitor attached to the
soldiers forearm they allow looking around corners without being seen.
Their perception of the cameras is significantly worse than that of the
human eye (Might be better in combination with an
[Equipment/Proposed/BarrelCamera/../Battlescape_headset](Equipment/Proposed/Battlescape_headset "wikilink")).
The line of sight of the cameras starts at the field in front of the
soldier and spanns the angle from 45° to 90° on both sides (straight
ahead is 0°).

As the monitor always needs some attention it drains 6 tus every round.
May be the soldier needs to spend another 10 tus to get an friend/enemy
recognition. The cameras can be switched on and off spending 2 tus.
