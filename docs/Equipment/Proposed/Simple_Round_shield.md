## Official Description

Cover-Shields are similar to the ones used by special units. A small and
easy to use shield, which protects head and trunk from light weapon
shots and knifes. The shield is one handed and doesn't affects moving
speed.

### Battle Implications

Reduces hit probability by 45%. Damage of small weapons is absorbed,
medium and large weapons damage is reduced. Effectively, [armor
protection](Skills/armor_protection "wikilink") is increased.

none

### Skill
