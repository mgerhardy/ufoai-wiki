## Pyrogel Torch

Originally designed for use by government special agents when the
situation required destruction of evidences. Military use was quite
limited, including only several operations against drug cartels, when it
was used in rapid raids for burning down drug deposits. This device
follows pretty simplistic design and represents a flashlight-sized
airtight plastic cylinder containing fast-burning binary pyrogel and
expulsion charge. It is activated much like a grenade, but after
removing the pin it is not thrown, but rather pointed at the target and
fired by pressing the lever. Suspended pyrogel is ejected towards target
and ignites upon release. Due to the nature of the burning agent, it
burns out within a second. The area within direct proximity is exposed
to extremely high temperatures, churning or igniting everything that
burns. Pyrogel torches were not specifically meant to be used against
personnel due to their close range where more convenient close-combat
weapons could be used, and excessive damaging capacity, rendering them
to be an overkill. However, nothing is too powerful against new alien
threat, and with the minor modifications the design was adopted as
PHALANX backup one-shot weapon for melee range.
