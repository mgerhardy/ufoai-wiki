Concept: Robust Steadicam-like device, modified for use as a
man-portable weapons mount.

Requirements: This isn't particularly high-tech, so should be available
early at moderate cost.

It's additional weight and bulk -- ideally would be an attachment over
the torso.

Benefits: Reduction in accuracy penalties associated with recoil.
Reduction in any accuracy penalties associated with shooting while on
the move, or while the target is slowly moving.

Penalties: Other than weight, the same stabilization (or at least the
need to temporarily disengage it) might make it harder to rapidly
acquire a target in a substantially different direction.

It would be slower to change weapons, and would be very awkward in melee
combat.

The obvious use would be for basic automatic weapons with substantial
recoil, where there's a need to be quite mobile compared to always
bracing.
