This is a portable mortar for shooting 100mm grenades. Before it can be
used it must be deployed (\~30 tus). When deployed it can shoot only in
one direction (+/-45°). Soldiers needs to be crouched to fire. The
Mortar has unlimited range and can target areas that are not seen by any
friendly unit. Mortar shells fired now hit the ground at the beginning
of the next round. This allows the enemy to run away from the target
zone. Nevertheless it is not visible for the enemies where the mortar
shell is going to hit the ground again. The mortar shells fly in a very
high parabola (15-20 height levels).

Loading and firing the mortar takes up over 30 tus.

Dropping and retaking a deployed mortar is very fast as the soldier just
needs to walk away.

The mortar is a very powerful weapon but has only limited use as it can
obviously only be used under open sky and has a high probability of
killing civilians when used without care.

## Ammunition

- All known grenade types (blast range and damage similar to the rocket
  launcher - may be slightly stronger)
- Mark II Grenades (Requires "Advanced Mortar Ballistic" research) can
  fall back from any direction (max 30° against vertical) to hit targets
  behind windows or one field below roofs. To achive that the shells are
  equipped with adustable fins whose behavior is preprogrammed.
- Flare grenades: They need one round to reach the height and then sink
  down to the ground during the next 5 rounds lighting up a shrinking
  area
- Eye in the Sky (needs "Shock Resistent Electronics" research): A
  Camera attached to a parachute. Has same flight behavior as the Flare
  Grenades but sees enemies from above. The Soldier handling the mortar
  needs to spend 20 tus every round to spot the enemies. Projectile can
  be retrieved when landed.

Mortar grenades need 3 (2?) squares and are very heavy.
