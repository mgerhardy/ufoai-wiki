Concept:

Small, lightweight, readily throwable object with battery, speakers, and
trigger system. Soldiers would throw or place these to warn civilians to
stay away from that location or flee if already nearby.

It would be reasonable to have two modes -- the second of which attracts
nearby civilians (to be used in areas known to be cleared) -- but that
opens the can of wyrms where one might ask whether the aliens exploit
that.
