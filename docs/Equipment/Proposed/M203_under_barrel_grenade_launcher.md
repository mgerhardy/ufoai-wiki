A grenade launcher mounted under an Assault rifle (poss. modified for
lasers and boltgun). Is the same as a snap shot from a grenade launcher
in TU's, range, and accuracy and has no other fire modes because it is
muzzle loaded. Cannot be used for reaction fire and cannot use the
'Flechette shells' Ammunition as the mounting cannot support the recoil.
Decreases the accuracy of the main weapon as the weight pulls the barrel
down.

Poss. Smoke shells with same effect as Smoke grenade with range of the
Grenade Launcher?

Uses High Explosive Skill.

Allows troops to havee fire support but still have close quarters
defense.
