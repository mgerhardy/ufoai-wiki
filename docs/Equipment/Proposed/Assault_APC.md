Assault APC can be transported to the battlefield as a support for the
troops. It takes 2x3 space in the troop compartment of the dropship.

It´s main use is in transporting the troops through enemy controlled
area (100 TU´s), unload them in safe location and provide fire support
for them.

The carrying capacity due to its small size is limited to 4 troops.

It´s armament consists of an infantry machine gun (can be upgraded by
replacing the machine gun with another researched weapon - laser gun,
plasma gun, anti-armor missile launcher etc.) and a smoke grenade
launcher.

It´s armor can be upgraded also. In it´s basic version the armor can
withstand handheld weapon fire and small amount of heavier weapons shots
and grenade explosions. An EM grenade can render it unusable in combat
(cannot fire or move until end of the mission and repair back on the
base), but not injuring the troops inside the APC). If the APC is
destroyed and holds troops, the troops inside it get wounded or killed.
