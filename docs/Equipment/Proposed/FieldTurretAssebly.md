## Description

An automatic fireing turret that consist of 5 seperate parts

- the Head holding the gun
- electronical devices for targeting
- skelet to assemble all parts
- armor-shild protecting front
- ammopack holding 60 rounds

which must all be brought to the battleground. (one soldier must
assemble all parts otherwise the device is broken. So the default is a
fully equiped soldier who cannot carry anything else)

shuts up to 3 times at the end of players turn if there is any target
(maybe in the same turn when the civilians move). Does not reserve any
TUs. After assembly it cannot be disassabled till the player won the
mission. Does not distinguish between soldiers/aliens/civilians/animals
(maybe own team). Takes three rounds to activate it self (so two rounds
for the soldier to get out of range or to cover behind something). Range
depends on gun/ammo. Spread is low. Armor is extremly direction
sensitive a shoot in the back and the turret is gone while only
explosions (HE) can harm the front (pushing the turret over).

**pros**

- For a team it is possble to block a path for anything.
- high firepower at a fixed point so it is an easy way to setup a trap
- possiblity to develop new parts indepent ( walking skeleton,
  alternative ammo/guns , better electronic)

**cons**

- may shuts down teammates or civilians
- many parts
- limited ammo
- easy to destroy from behind
