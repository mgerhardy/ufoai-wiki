## Official Description

An improved chaingun with great firerate and versatility. Featuring six
carbon-polymer barrels it can fire three types of ammo: armour
piercing - AP, high explosive HE, and incendiary IN. It also supports
heavier but expensive depleted Uranium armour piercing (DUAP) rounds for
maximum damage against armoured targets.

### Battle Implications

Though heavy this weapon has a relative good accuracy, with best results
in the hands of experienced soldiers. The drawback is that can be fired
only in a standing position and the large ammo consumption. Firing
modes: - directed(normal) shot: 10 rounds - spread shot: 20 rounds fired
over an area (more TUs required), for shoting multiple targets. DUAP
rounds can pass through walls, causing half damage at impact.
