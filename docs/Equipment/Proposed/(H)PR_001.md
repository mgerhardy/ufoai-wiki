The (Human) Plasma Rifle Model 1 is a human weapon developed using
Plasma and Boltgun Technology.

When Experimenting with alien plasma technology, it was found that a
plasma based on a hydrogen-iron mixture was highly magnetic. Superheated
plasma bonded with the iron filings to form a denser material than
standard weapons grade plasma. Although a totally accidental discovery,
it has revolutionized human plasma technology.

Plasma 002, as it was known, would actually penetrate the target before
'splashing' and could cause huge internal burns. a smaller amount could
be carried as it could be fired in much smaller bolts. The huge heat
generated by the plasma would cause the iron filings to become highly
magnetically charged and the plasma was naturally held together.

The ER 001 uses the 'spinneret' technology from the alien rifles to coat
the bolts in a thin film of plastic to contain them, and the railgun
technology of the bolter rifles was used to fire the bolts. Using
magnetic pulses along the rails, the bolt is 'pulled' down the barrel
and the resulting high momentum fires it out of the barrel at the
target.

The bolts fired by this rifle are the same size as a .50 calibre round.
This is because the density of the projectiles allows the round to
penetrate the target, and so only a small amount is needed to damage a
target. The penetrative effect of these rounds is decreased with size,
so larger rounds require a shaped plastic container to maintain this
effect.
