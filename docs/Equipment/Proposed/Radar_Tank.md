- A Radar Tank is a 2x2 vehicle with no weapons. It has a radar unit,
  which allows seeing aliens in a limited radius even through walls.
- Alternatively a radar unit can be handled as a weapon to be mounted on
  an UGV.
- Better radar units with increased radius can be researched.
- Possible counter measure: Radar decoys, which looks like normal
  soldiers/aliens, but are detected as decoys as soon as a soldier sees
  it.
