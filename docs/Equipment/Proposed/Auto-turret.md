This auto turret is deployable by soldiers. It consist of tripod and a
500 round magazine, along with targeting/movement sensor and computer.
It has different modes of operation:

1\. Manual Control - A soldier with a remote control manually selects a
target and firing mode (short burst, long burst, very long burst -
useful for grouped enemies).

2 Semi-Autonomous - Computer auto-selects targets, but a soldier with a
remote control must choose a firing mode (thus giving the order to
fire).

3 Fully-Autonomous - Computer controls both target selection and firing
mode. Beware: in this mode it will engage everything it can see - not
only enemies but friendlies too.

Very useful if you're short on soldiers. There are two main uses - first
to secure the drop zone to prevent the hijacking of the drop ship and to
secure the flanks/rear in the area. Second comes to placement for base
invasions - placed in already dedicated and vital places helps in base
defense. In this case they are directly controlled from the Command
Center.
