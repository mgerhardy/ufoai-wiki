## Official Description

A metal bar with a ball-shaped end made from titanium, also known as a
typical 'wood' type golf club.

### Battle Implications

Some golfers had their game disturbed by aliens, and they're ready for
revenge... Effectiveness has been disputed, but it seems the alien's
strong armor is not very sensitive to this improvised weapon.
