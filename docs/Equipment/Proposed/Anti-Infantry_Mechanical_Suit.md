## Official Description

The Anti-Infantry Mechanical Suit, or A.I.M.S, is a motorized, thick
armored suit that the soldier can "wear" on the battlefield. Each "hand"
is really a heavy weapon mounted on the end of the arm. This will allow
the soldier to use a pair of heavy weapons on the field and if you
include the heavy armor with strong, motorized movement, you have one
terrifying war machine. The armor is heavy enough to withstand most
projectile fire and with more advanced armor, this machine will be even
more impervious to damage. Unfortunately, this suit takes up four times
more space than a soldier, limiting the terrain this soldier can enter.
More advanced versions will allow this suit to hover, have different
vision types, and even have a thin, folding arm that can extend out and
heal surrounding soldiers.

### Battle Implications

This suit will increase running speed, as well as jump higher heights as
well. And with two heavy weapons armed and ready, this soldier will be
ready for anything. However, the soldier will not be able to climb
stairs, nor ladders and will not be able to enter buildings as well.
Only heavy weapons can be mounted.

### Damage Type

Depends on the weapons mounted.

### Skill

None required.

### Speciality

Depends on the equipment mounted.
