A ballistic shield or tactical shield is a hand-held shield that is
capable of defeating handguns, shotguns and submachine guns. Less common
are heavier and thicker rifle-protection shields that are mounted on
wheels for ease of mobility. Ballistic shields have been used by law
enforcement throughout the 20th Century, as a method of providing cover
for other team members. Application of a high performance ceramic
coating has led to a high resistance to plasma and particle beam
weapons.
