## Official Description

This weapon consists of multiple metal-clad graphite rods that are
screwed together before use to make a 2m long quarterstaff, it is
designed for knocking aliens unconcious, disarming them, or killing
them. Can only be used at melee range.

Developed to offer soldiers a last resort against aliens with very tough
hides that the combat knife is unable to pierce, this weapon resembles
the wooden staves often used in medieval times, it consists of multiple
pieces to make storage more practical.

### Battle Implications

Although limited to melee combat this weapon is very good at preventing
aliens from performing any successful attacks with any sort of weapon,
what it lacks in elegance it makes up for in its unique ability to
bypass armor and cause blunt trauma.

The Knock Out attack can be used to stun aliens with a sharp blow to the
side of the head, this does some stun damage and some blunt damage.

The Disarm/Injure attack can be used to cause aliens to drop their
weapon(s), sometimes breaking limbs in the process.

The Brawl attack performs 3 quick hits to random parts of the target's
body, these do less damage than the other attacks but still stand a
chance of breaking limbs, often reducing the target's combat
effectiveness, and they may or may not disarm the target.

Storing/retrieving the weapon from one's backpack incurs an additional
TU cost due to disassembly/assembly, it is unable to fit in any other
inventory space, no such penalty exists when picking up/dropping the
weapon.
