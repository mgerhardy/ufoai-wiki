Proposal: The Bolter concept provides an opportunity to upgrade
PHALANX's current riot shotgun.

Description: Rather than a single individual projectile, the bolt
shotgun uses a thin ferromagnetic sabot encasing several dozen
flechettes. The flechettes are newly-designed darts comprised of the
newly discovered alien material, giving them improved penetration and
range over standard ammunition. The downside is that reloading is still
an unwieldly process, and despite the use of alien materials and a
shortened barrel the weapon is a bit heavier than would be preferable.

Requires: Bolter and Alien Materials researched

Pros: Slightly higher damage than riot shotgun. Flechette shells spread
like standard rounds but also pierce armor like slugs.

Cons: Heavier than normal shotgun, expensive and costly to manufacture
(uses alien materials in construction of weapon and ammo). Slow to
reload.
