## Unofficial Description

A multibarreled gatling gun with high rate and power. It uses rifle
caliber ammunition and could shot at up to 10,000 rpm

EDIT: The XAW95 sorta fall into this category. We have the model, but
it's not a campaign weapon.

EDIT: I have a proper minigun model almost complte somewhere. Like the
Painless from Predator, complete with backpack.
