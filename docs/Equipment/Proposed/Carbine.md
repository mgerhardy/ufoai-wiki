## Official Description

NOTE: Not sure of a decent name, I've just left it as 'Carbine' - MNONE)

A lighter assault weapon (for those who want a faster moving,
close-quaters squad/detatchment). Basically fulfills the traditional
carbine role, i.e. for mobile squads.

### Battle Implications

Similar to an assault rifle, but slightly more accurate and a lower rate
of fire and range. Uses slightly less TUs than an assault rifle - hence
the use as a more mobile weapon.

Primary fire: Single shot. Secondary fire: Two/three-shot burst.

Effectiveness varies, good accuracy at short range, dropping off rapidly
at longer ranges.

Possibly there could be equivilants for other weapons ('though in the
case of plama weapons this role is pretty much taken by the atomiser)
such as a laser carbine which somehow does more damage at short range
than a normal laser rifle but loses potency at medium to long ranges.

\- Edit by Mayhem: I agree with the lower TU, but question the better
accuracy from a weapon that will, basically be an assault rifle with a
cut down barrel and stock. A Carbine version of the Assault Rifle
should: 1) Have the same ammo. 2) Have lower accuracy and a lower
effective range - but better than the SMG. 3) Possibly have slightly
lower damage (less muzzle velocity, assuming the bullet does not reach
"terminal velocity" within the assault rifle barrel) - but still better
than SMG. 4) A lower TU use and faster reaction fire (but not as
low/quick as the SMG). 5) The same fire modes as the assault
rifle.--[Mayhem](User:Mayhem "wikilink") 19:52, 14 July 2008 (CEST)
