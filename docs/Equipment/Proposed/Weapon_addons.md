Optical scope (something like the svarowski scope) -adds accuracy (+20%
of soldier's) -weapon uses more TUs in close range, but less at long
range (dunno if it's doable)

Reflex scope (think R6 Vegas) -adds accuracy (+5% of soldier's) -weapon
uses more TUs at long range, whilst using less in CQC

Supressor -weapon is weaker at long range -adds stealth elements

M203 (already listed)

Front grip -adds accuracy (+10% of soldier's)

Lightweight frame -adds TUs to unit using the addon

Thermal scope -adds accuracy (+10% of soldier's) -soldier detects aliens
in his line of sight within 15 movement units

This is all I came up with for now, of course, graphic models are
needed. Alas, we would need a new customization menu at the base (new
option at the armory?)
