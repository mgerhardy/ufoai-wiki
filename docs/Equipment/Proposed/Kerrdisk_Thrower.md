## Official Description

After experimenting with the gruesome alien Kerrblade our scientists
have found a way to create a similar form of the alien plastics from
which the Kerrblades are made. The largest thing we could produce are
ten inches wide disks which match the basic properties of the kerrblade.
We devised a rather crude but effective weapon which can throw these
disks with very high velocity, adding a spin effect which is devastating
to any material, including alien armor. Due to the high costs of
producing one disk, we are considering adapting the disk to be used as a
melee weapon as well.

### Battle Implications

This weapon is very effective at close to medium range, but very
inaccurate at great distances. The disk is capable of passing through
several victims and even through concrete walls. However, due to the
large cost of one disk, it can't be considered as a viable solution for
the moment.
