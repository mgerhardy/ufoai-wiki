## Official Description

A small but very powerful bomb with no external detonator. Smaller than
a grenade its smoothly shaped like an egg. The outer shell is made of an
very strong alloy, and after extensive research, no way of opening the
shell has been found. The research made suggest that the device is
controlled by thought, probably by a sequence of codes or words
implanted in the alien's mind.

### Battle Implications

To avoid capture, some aliens trigger their detonator, killing
everything on a 50 meters radius with a powerful blast.
