## Holographic decoy

This is a throwable device that first stabilizes itself on the ground,
then creates a hologram of its owner above itself with a set of
miniature laser emitters. The same emitters also create an area of
heated air in the same spot, mimicking a soldier's heat signature.
Alongside, small resonator imitates heartbeat and appropiate pheromons
are being released from the built-in container. Due to device's small
size, its operation time is restricted approximately to a minute. The
main purpose is to mislead the enemy about personnel location and to
lure enemy fire, revealing their positions.
