## UN-Official Description

Many alien races are susceptible to fire - because of that need of
weapon inclidung it starts to be urgent. Phoenix scientists come with
interesting solution. Instead of creating small grenade-like device they
made underbarrel one-shot fire weapon. It works just like shotgun -
shooting one huge bullet setting things on fire.

### Battle Implications

Thanks to that weapon snipers and normal soldiers aren't so susceptible
to aliens attacks. It has some drawbacks though. Close range made it
dangerous to user too and there is only one bullet. But besides that
facts - it's nice weapon for close combat encounters.
