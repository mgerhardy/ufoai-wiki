## Official Description

The concussion grenade is an improvement over the standard flashbang.
This grenade can be launched from the Grenade Launcher and renders the
target unconscious (as apposed to merely stunned). This is still
ammunition to be wary of as the average civilian may not be up to
withstanding the psychical stress of the concussion.

### Battle Implications

Similar to the flashbang, but it can be launched from the Grenade
Launcher -- thus gaining range, auto fire, and air burst benefits.
