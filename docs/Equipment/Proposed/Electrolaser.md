## Official Description

A heavy weapon based on firing twin ionizing lasers to create a path for
a high voltage electric arc (lightning bolt), due to high amperage this
weapon usually kills the target, and due to high voltage it usually
stuns anything that is not immediately killed.

### Battle Implications

Similar in use to a sniper rifle but with more limited range and
requiring Heavy Weapons specialty instead of Sniper Rifles, capable of
killing or stunning many aliens that are otherwise difficult to take
down.

Effectiveness varies by target biology and armor type (conductive skin
or armor can significantly reduce the effectiveness of this weapon).
