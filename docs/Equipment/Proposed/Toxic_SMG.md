## UN-Official Description

This new close-mid range weapon is a child of human mind and alien body.
It looks like crossbreed of SMG and gatling gun. And off course -
needles. Idea of new weapon is very simple. Needles (darts) covered in
toxic substance, which give a hell of headache to most of the aliens. It
sadly kills weaker objects, but we can't do nothing about it. Loading
and trigger system are still the same. The main change is barrel - now
with gatling-type needle gun. It can throw about 5 needles per second
and has a magazine which contain about 100 of them.

### Battle Implications

This weapon is obviously created to capture live alien specimens. Off
course it's completely useless against robots. It's advantage is a good
punch (needles can pierce even medium armor) and cheap, simple
construction. Disadvantages - short range and there is always a chance
not breaking armor. And without that - we're dead.
