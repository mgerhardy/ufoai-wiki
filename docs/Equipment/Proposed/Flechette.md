Official description: Since the beginning of this war, we've been
expecting to capture ennemy in almost every missions. These flechettes,
made to fit into every sniper rifle, are filled with the same gas as the
gas grenades. A single hit on any alien will put him down, without
killing him.

Combat application: These ammunitions for the sniper rifle should be
able to allow alien capture without being in an open area, like the
grenades, and will also allow for far more distant capture.

Flechettes are not any kind of stun weapon. Depending on what type they
are they are heavy armour-piercing rounds or short range anti-personnel
weapons.

More generally, any kind of projectile that can be delivered with
ballistics similar to a sniper rifle will have a lethal amount of
mechanical energy, filling it with a chemical agent won't prevent the
target from being killed. In gameplay terms, capturing live aliens is
supposed to involve increased risks to offset the research benefits.
