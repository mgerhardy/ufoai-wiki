## UN-Official Description

Because of use on battlefield many fire-based weapons there apeared a
need of device to put fire down. As normal fire extinguishers are too
bulky and heavy scientists tried to create smaller and better version.
Our efforts surpassed expectations. Small, 0,75kg extinguisher is even
better then big one. With these small parameters comes one more thing -
in times of need this device could be used as a weapon. All because of
fact, that it uses higly cooled substance which can deliver fatal cold
blows to not armored organic tissue or even robotic circuits.

### Battle Implications

It's simple device made to put out fires. It could be also used as
weapon, but damage isn't very high, and range is very small - just a bit
more then melee weapons.

### Damage Type

- cryogenic (?)
