The emp grenade utilizing advances in power storage technology, pulsed
power and room temperature superconductors this grenade uses a series of
transformers to discharge a a large amount over a short amount of time.
This grenade was developed by US DOD Phalanx scientests, as part of the
original Phalanx program, to even the odds by disabling advanced
technology. While our firearms are unaffected the enemies weapons rely
extensively on stored electrical energy and magnetic fields engineered
on a nano scale. Due to the nature of particle beam weaponry's reliance
on miniaturized a cyclotron to contain high velocity particles the
sudden loss of containment would cause a catastrophic failure. Plasma
weaponry is rendered usless and robots sustain serious damage.
