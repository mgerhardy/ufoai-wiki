## Official Description

A full-face mask that filters the air a soldier breathes, removing any
harmful particles and protecting the soldier's face from toxins like
CHOKE gas. Could perhaps work as an extension to the soldier's armor.

## References

A number of research and background documents refer to the need for
full-face masks for PHALANX soldiers. In particular, the Smoke Grenade
and Gas Grenade backgrounds mention that gas masks should be used.
Another use might be on missions to alien planets or space vessels.
There would be no reason to believe that the aliens would use an
atmosphere like Earth's, especially when the Alien Breathing Apparatus
report states otherwise. Full face gas masks would enable PHALANX
soldiers to operate in these environments for a longer period of time.
