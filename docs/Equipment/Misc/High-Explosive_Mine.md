## Official Description

### Battle Implications

When a soldier sets this device, it becomes invisible. The mine becomes
active on the next team's turn, so a soldier who sets this should move
off the square the mine is deployed on. When any unit (including the
friendly team's units and civilians!) steps on the mine, it explodes,
damaging all units in its blast radius.
