## Official Description

### Battle Implications

This mine has the same basic functionality as the Stun Grenade - it
emits ultra-high frequency sound waves when it goes off. The main
advantage of the mine variant compared to the grenade variant is that
it's slightly more powerful, and obviously the victim will be at the
center of the blast radius, ensuring maximum effect.

Like the Stun Grenade, the Stun Mine has no effect on mechanical units,
though it will still be triggered by those units.
