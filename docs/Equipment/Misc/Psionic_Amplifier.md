## Official Description

### Battle Implications

This device allows a soldier to attack a target's mind. Psionic attacks
are barely affected by armor, and in addition to causing pain and panic,
skilled Psionics can cause a victim to fall unconscious, or even take
over a victim's mind. The Psionic Amplifier has a long range, but the
victim must be visible for the attack to succeed.
