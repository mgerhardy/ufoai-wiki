## Official Description

### Battle Implications

The Psionic Linker allows two Psionics to establish a bond with one
another. Their minds temporarily join as one, and the psionic force of
that mind is equal to the combined psionic force of the two minds
separate. Usually, the linked mind will reside in one body, while the
other is left inanimate.
