## Official Description

### Battle Implications

This device acts like a proximity mine, but instead of exploding it
emits a strong psionic pulse, overloading the neural pathways of any
unit who is too close when it goes off. Most units will lose
consciousness when caught in the blast radius. Those who retain
consciousness will panic, unless their psionic resistance is unusually
high. Once the mine is activated it is rendered useless.
