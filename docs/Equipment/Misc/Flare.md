This illuminates the surrounding area. Useful on night missions.

## Suggestions

Standard magnesium flare. Used to create light in dark enviroments and
illuminate enemy postions. --[Centron](User:Centron "wikilink")

Am I right the standard magnesium flare would be fired into the air,
would slowly flow down on a parachute and light entire map for several
turns until it burns? It's nicely simple, but I'd rather occasionally
(on really dark maps) throw small chemical flares around so that my
soldiers see everything but are not seen. If rare, it's fun.

Alternative: A flare (chemical or electrical) that can be picked up and
thrown again. How to script it? --[Bandobras](User:Bandobras "wikilink")
