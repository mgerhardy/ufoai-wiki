## Official Description

Not really a "mine", this device is nevertheless handled like one. Once
set and activated, this mine will wait for any unit (including the
friendly team's units and civilians!) comes close enough, and will fire
a laser burst in reaction fire at that unit. The damage of the laser
burst is equivalent to a Laser Pistol's, but the accuracy is almost
100%. Once it fires, the mine will become visible and can be destroyed.
It will continue to operate until it is destroyed, or until its ammo
runs out.
