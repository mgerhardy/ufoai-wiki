This page is intended to monitor and prevent the "ültimate überweapon"
syndrome. Eventually, all equpiment that can be obsoleted should be
listed here and **every** other equipment piece should have its
advantages to the very end-game. By obsolete equipment piece I mean one
that in mid to late-game, with no research, resource and financial
constraints, can be replaced with good effect for every player,
regardless of his play-style, strategic situation, difficulty setting,
etc.

Let's not take price or market availability into account (though they
will be useful balancing factors to make even obsolete weapons viable in
the early to mid-game). OTOH even skills and inventory sizes should be
somewhat considered (e.g. it is impossible for a primary weapon to
obsolete a secondary weapon, but a single-handed sidearm obsoletes any
roughly equivalent primary weapon).

Damage type should be considered only if there is a considerable
susceptibility in a strong alien, or resistance in most strong aliens or
alien armour types. Generally, damage type should not be a weapon's only
advantage, as it gets boring (though a really gameplay-friendly
exception, e.g. fetching the lovely old flamethrower from the cellar
against a really tough late-game alien, could be nice). Big resistances
or susceptibilities tend to force players to have huge inventories,
while there should be many equally viable weapon sets that players
choose according to their personal play-style or even current mood.

## Primary Weapons

- [Assault Rifle](Equipment/Primary_Weapons/Assault_Rifle "wikilink")
  mostly obsoleted by any of the other rifles (sometimes skills differ).
- [Sniper Rifle](Equipment/Primary_Weapons/Sniper_Rifle "wikilink")
  mostly obsoleted by [Particle Beam
  Rifle](Equipment/Primary_Weapons/Particle_Beam_Rifle "wikilink") (and
  comparable to the primary fire mode of the [Laser
  Rifle](Equipment/Primary_Weapons/Laser_Rifle "wikilink")).
- [Frag Grenade
  Shells](Equipment/Primary_Weapons/Grenade_Launcher "wikilink")
  obsoleted by [Plasma Grenade
  Shells](Equipment/Primary_Weapons/Grenade_Launcher "wikilink").
- [Bolter Rifle](Equipment/Primary_Weapons/Bolter_Rifle "wikilink")
  mostly obsoleted by [Laser
  Rifle](Equipment/Primary_Weapons/Laser_Rifle "wikilink"). Bolter Rifle
  has longer range, but too low accuracy to make use of it.
- [Machine Gun](Equipment/Primary_Weapons/Machine_Gun "wikilink") mostly
  obsoleted by [Plasma
  Blaster](Equipment/Primary_Weapons/Plasma_Blaster "wikilink"). Machine
  Gun has longer range, but does not do enough damage to stay
  competitive.

## Secondary Weapons

- [Combat Knife](Equipment/Secondary_Weapons/Combat_Knife "wikilink")
  obsoleted by
  [Kerrblade](Equipment/Secondary_Weapons/Kerrblade "wikilink") (not
  quite, because Combat Knife is much smaller) and [Plasma
  Blade](Equipment/Secondary_Weapons/Plasma_Blade "wikilink") and
  [Monomolecular
  Blade](Equipment/Secondary_Weapons/Monomolecular_Blades "wikilink")
  (completely).
- [9mm Pistol](Equipment/Secondary_Weapons/9mm_Pistol "wikilink")
  obsoleted by any of the other pistols.
- [Submachine
  Gun](Equipment/Secondary_Weapons/Submachine_Gun "wikilink") mostly
  obsoleted by [Plasma
  Pistol](Equipment/Secondary_Weapons/Plasma_Pistol "wikilink"), even if
  Plasma Pistol has a bit lower range and different secondary fire mode
  skill.
- [Riot Shotgun](Equipment/Secondary_Weapons/Riot_Shotgun "wikilink")
  obsoleted by [Plasma
  Pistol](Equipment/Secondary_Weapons/Plasma_Pistol "wikilink"), though
  Plasma Pistol is somewhat slower to use and has a different primary
  fire mode skill.

## Misc

- [Frag Grenade](Equipment/Misc/Frag_Grenade "wikilink") obsoleted by
  [Plasma Grenade](Equipment/Misc/Plasma_Grenade "wikilink").
- [High-Explosive Mine](Equipment/Misc/High-Explosive_Mine "wikilink")
  obsoleted by [Plasma Mine](Equipment/Misc/Plasma_Mine "wikilink").
- [Laser Proximity Mine](Equipment/Misc/Laser_Proximity_Mine "wikilink")
  mostly obsoleted by [Tachyon Proximity
  Mine](Equipment/Misc/Tachyon_Proximity_Mine "wikilink").

## Armor

- [Combat Armour](Equipment/Armor/Kevlar_Vest "wikilink") obsoleted by
  [Nanocomposite
  Armor](Equipment/Armour/Nanocomposite_Armour "wikilink").
- [Nanocomposite
  Armor](Equipment/Armour/Nanocomposite_Armour "wikilink") mostly
  obsoleted by [Heavy Nano
  Armor](Translation:Nano_heavy_armour_txt/en "wikilink") (which is,
  however, almost three times heavier).
- [Nanocomposite
  Armor](Equipment/Armour/Nanocomposite_Armour "wikilink") mostly
  obsoleted by [Hover Armor](Equipment/Armor/Hover_Armor "wikilink")
  (which is, however, more than twice as heavy).
- [Nanocomposite
  Armor](Equipment/Armour/Nanocomposite_Armour "wikilink") mostly
  obsoleted by [Psi-Amp Armor](Equipment/Armor/Psi-Amp_Armor "wikilink")
  (which is, however, almost two times heavier).

## Counter-examples (unobvious)

- [Kerrblade](Equipment/Secondary_Weapons/Kerrblade "wikilink") is
  **not** obsoleted by [Plasma
  Blade](Equipment/Secondary_Weapons/Plasma_Blade "wikilink"), because
  it does much higher melee damage per 1 TU.
- [Flamethrower](Equipment/Primary_Weapons/Flamethrower "wikilink") is
  not obsoleted by anything, since it can be used to precisely and
  cheaply set ablaze any nearby spot on the map. (Perhaps it could also
  induce panic.)
- [Grenade
  Launcher](Equipment/Primary_Weapons/Grenade_Launcher "wikilink") with
  [Plasma Grenade
  Shells](Equipment/Primary_Weapons/Grenade_Launcher "wikilink") is not
  obsoleted by [Plasma
  Blaster](Equipment/Primary_Weapons/Plasma_Blaster "wikilink"), because
  the latter does not allow to reach around a corner, since plasma balls
  explode on impact instead of bouncing.

## Top tier set of basic weapons

This set is good enough under most circumstances and it should be
obvious to newbies (if a totally clueless newbie chooses only the three
Particle Beam weapons he should still have chances on easy; please
correct, improve and discuss):

- [Particle Beam
  Rifle](Equipment/Primary_Weapons/Particle_Beam_Rifle "wikilink")
  (assault and sniper)
- [Particle Beam
  Cannon](Equipment/Primary_Weapons/Particle_Beam_Cannon "wikilink")
  (straight line explosive) {discussion: Some players don't find this
  weapon useful. Though it deals massive amounts of damage, the high TU
  cost and short range mean it doesn't get fired often.}
- [Plasma Blaster](Equipment/Primary_Weapons/Plasma_Blaster "wikilink")
  (explosive over obstacles, high volume reaction fire)
- [Particle Beam
  Pistol](Equipment/Secondary_Weapons/Particle_Beam_Pistol "wikilink")
  (medium range, one-handed sidearm)
- [Plasma Pistol](Equipment/Secondary_Weapons/Plasma_Pistol "wikilink")
  (close range sidearm)
- [Plasma Grenade](Equipment/Misc/Plasma_Grenade "wikilink") and some
  utility grenades

## Top tier common alternatives

- instead of [Plasma
  Pistol](Equipment/Secondary_Weapons/Plasma_Pistol "wikilink") either
  [Plasma Blade](Equipment/Secondary_Weapons/Plasma_Blade "wikilink") or
  [Kerrblade](Equipment/Secondary_Weapons/Kerrblade "wikilink"); weaker
  but enable devastating melee
- instead of [Plasma
  Blaster](Equipment/Primary_Weapons/Plasma_Blaster "wikilink") the pair
  of [Grenade
  Launcher](Equipment/Primary_Weapons/Grenade_Launcher "wikilink")
  (explosive over obstacles) and [Heavy
  Laser](Equipment/Primary_Weapons/Heavy_Laser "wikilink") or [Bolter
  Rifle](Equipment/Primary_Weapons/Bolter_Rifle "wikilink") (heavy);
  weaker explosive and two weapons needed, but explosive bounces around
  corners and longer range heavy
- instead of [Particle Beam
  Rifle](Equipment/Primary_Weapons/Particle_Beam_Rifle "wikilink") the
  pair of [Rocket
  Launcher](Equipment/Primary_Weapons/Rocket_Launcher "wikilink")
  (straight line explosive) and either [Plasma
  Rifle](Equipment/Primary_Weapons/Plasma_Rifle "wikilink") (assault and
  heavy) or [Laser
  Rifle](Equipment/Primary_Weapons/Laser_Rifle "wikilink") (assault and
  sniper); weaker assault and two weapons needed, but this enables an
  array of yet different possible exchanges...

## Analogous bottom tier set of basic weapons

This set should be quite obvious, as well, allow some variations and be
very cheap to research:

- [Assault Rifle](Equipment/Primary_Weapons/Assault_Rifle "wikilink")
  (assault)
- [Rocket
  Launcher](Equipment/Primary_Weapons/Rocket_Launcher "wikilink")
  (straight line explosive)
- [Sniper Rifle](Equipment/Primary_Weapons/Sniper_Rifle "wikilink")
  (sniper)
- [Grenade
  Launcher](Equipment/Primary_Weapons/Grenade_Launcher "wikilink")
  (explosive over obstacles)
- [Bolter Rifle](Equipment/Primary_Weapons/Bolter_Rifle "wikilink")
  (heavy, needs research)
- [9mm Pistol](Equipment/Secondary_Weapons/9mm_Pistol "wikilink")
  (one-handed sidearm)
- [SMG](Equipment/Secondary_Weapons/Submachine_Gun "wikilink") (close
  range sidearm)
- [Frag Grenade](Equipment/Misc/Frag_Grenade "wikilink") and some
  utility grenades
