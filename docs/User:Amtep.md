# About

My name is Richard Braakman. I have previously been active as a Debian
Developer, but I have retired from that. I'm interested in creating and
promoting games on Linux, as part of the Linux World Domination
initiative.

Other free software activity:

- Initial author (with Christian Schwartz) of
  [Lintian](http://lintian.debian.org/), the Debian package checker
- Worked on [Kannel](http://kannel.org), the WAP and SMS gateway
- Wrote [elice](http://clueonic.org/elice/archive/), a compiler for
  PureBasic (via C++) in order to free [Lost
  Labyrinth](http://www.lostlabyrinth.com/)

I've always been interested in compilers and interpreters. In general I
prefer code whose user interface can be described in terms of file
formats, packet layouts and socket operations, but I'm learning about
GUIs in order to make games. I have several game ideas ready to go; too
many, in fact, since I can't seem to concentrate on any of them for long
enough to make something happen.
