## Official Description

The result on an extensive Antarean Ortnok-machine interface research
program these Ortnoks retain little of their original body. Limbs and
internal organs have been replaced by machines, and the skull has been
reinforced with a metal shell that was grafted onto the bone. Cyborg
Ortnoks retain their verocious nature, however, and are quite aggressive
in combat.

### Technical

Unlike normal Ortnoks, the Cyborg Ortnok's weaponry is built into it's
arm modules. These modules range from heavy plasma cannons to grenade
launchers.
