[Headdie](User:Headdie "wikilink") Would it be handy to add smoke
grenades to the potential ammo for this weapon? maybe instead of using
belts the weapon has integrated auto loaders of some sort so ammo can be
quickly swapped at any time and the ammo store able to take 2 types so
the player has to decide if they want 2 kill options for different
ranges or a kill and a tactical option such as smoke or flash-bang.
@Trifler: I like the fire mode idea and I think it would be the most
user friendly way to do multiple ammo types.
