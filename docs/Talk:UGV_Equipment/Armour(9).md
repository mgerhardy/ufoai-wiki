I think UGVs should not have armour as an equippable item. Each UGV
should have its own resistance ratings.

- It will be difficult to model multiple types of armours on a single
  UGV. It means we'll need to have several versions of each UGV and in
  many cases this will lead to less than high quality results.
- It will simplify UGV management from the player's perspective. He will
  upgrade his armour by developing newer, better UGVs.
- There is a strong likelihood that UGVs will have interchangable
  weapons (machine gun/rocket launcher) with multiple ammunition types.
  It may also have interchangable equipment to improve detection and
  accuracy. If the armour is interchangable as well it will reduce the
  differentiation between different UGVs. The only thing we will have
  left to entice the player to develop a new UGV is improved TU.
- It also makes a certain sense. Vehicles can often get armour plates
  bolted onto the outside or inserted into areas, but it's another thing
  to wrap an unmanned vehicle in an entirely new armour. They need to be
  load balanced and their weight distribution effects motor functions.
  This means it's not easy to just add a new armour from the perspective
  of programming the UGV's balancing and movement software.
