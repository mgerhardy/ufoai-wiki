## terrain particles

there is written in header of file: "// Put footsteps and particles for
different terrain into this file", and this definition was contained in
first draft of the file: <code>

    terrain tex_nature/desert {
        footstepsound "misc/footstep_desert"
        particle "desert_dust"
        }

</code>

But now no particles are defined in the file, and no mentions are in the
article.

So, question is: Does this feature workable and hidden-forgetten, or it
was abanoned completely?
