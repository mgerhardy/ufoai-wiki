What are the Item types numbers? How do they relate to the "category"
field?

Additionally, how do the spread numbers work and how does the skill
effect this spread number? Actually, I have a lot of questions here,
like what ROF does exactly, why it differs from 'shots'

Please code-dive and complete the descriptions. Come to IRC if you have
any problems understanding the code. From what I remember ROF says how
many bullet per second are shot, while spread says what is the maximum
(or average? measured in degrees?) deviance from the intended fire-line.
