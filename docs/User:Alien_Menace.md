# About

- Alien Menace is one of many named Paul Kohler.
- I landlord, study, and fix things for a living.

I'm fairly good at noticing differing syntax, misused words, visual
anomalies or glitches, small dips in carpet, and other similar things.
Though I practice keeping my mouth shut about these a lot.

I'm an aspiring graphics programmer. I maintain a vivid imagination. I
enjoy writing, but I'm by no means a professional. Likewise for artwork
and making music.
