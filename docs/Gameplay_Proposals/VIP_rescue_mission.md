This is a proposal to implement some rescue VIP civilian mission type.

## Introduction

The main goal of this missions is to keep a VIP civilan alive until the
end.

If this civilian is killed, the mission will failed, and the VIP's
nation will be discontent.

## Modes

### Protect VIP

In this mode the VIP is somewhere on the map, you must kill all aliens
and got VIP alive until the end.

The alien will try to kill the VIP as last civilian or if a soldier is
near the VIP.

### Escort VIP

In this mode the VIP is near soldiers, you must escort him to a point,
like cross a bridge, escape a building, go to the aircraft...

Alien will kill VIP in priority?

### Rescue VIP

In this mode the VIP bleeding and lost health points on each turn. you
must hurry to find and treat him before is dead.

The alien will try to kill the vip as last civilian or if a soldier is
near the VIP

- i think there is a TODO item about bleeding in general. probably best
  to implement that (and improve medikits etc) before having a special
  case here. --[Blondandy](User:Blondandy "wikilink") 15:24, 8 January

## Civilian control

A VIP can be controlled by the player only if he's visible and near a
soldier (like to ear orders).

Soldier could have a charismatic property that increase the distance to
control a VIP.

## Kind of VIP

### Scientific

He will give you a research improvement (new technology discover,
increase some percentage of research).

### Political man

Give better happiness of man's nation.

### PHALANX soldier

Give better moral to all team.

### Protagonist avatar

Protagonist himself lives in first PHALANX base. He can participate in
base attack mission. He can be evacuated on attack but soldiers receives
moral penalty, if not soldiers receives bonus during base defend. If
protagonist dies game of course will be lost. Aliens will try to kill
him in priority.
