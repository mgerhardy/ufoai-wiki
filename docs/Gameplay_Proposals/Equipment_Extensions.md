## Equipment extensions

This is a proposal for extensions for equipment. Basically, certain
equipment should have one or more extension slots in which extensions
can be removed. This is similar to equipping aircraft. Not every piece
of equipment should have such slots (knives, grenades, ammo and medikits
would not have any, for example), but major equipment such as guns and
armour should.

Extensions should have some kind of beneficial effect. For example,
extensions to weapons could affect the random damage modifier, the base
damage, the amount of shots, ammo usage, et cetera. Armour extensions
could influence protection against some or all damage weights or affect
the TU penalty (assuming the latter is implemented). Or perhaps they
could affect stealth or available postures.

Equipment extensions will further deepen gameplay, as long as care is
taken that the system does not cross into tedious micromanagement.

- A bayonet sounds like a sensible extension for most large fire-arms.
  The development would parallel the combat knife

- Sound like something that I personally think should be added, what you
  describe sound something like the system in UFO: Afterlight. You could
  add things such as infravision, cloaking, shields, etc to the
  spacesuits in it. You could also add things to weapons that changed
  their stats, like add some parts to a laser rifle that makes it
  consume more ammo but it does more damage and has a special shot, more
  or less being a heavy laser rifle. [RF](User:RF "wikilink") 19:17, 21

- For weapons -- lights, different sight types, grenade launcher, flash
  suppressor, bipod et al are obvious. A proper implementation would
  have specific attachment points (possibly filled with 'default' stuff
  -- like any bona-fide sniping rifle should default with some kind of
  scope) rather than a number of completely generic slots.

For armor, an improved version of the inserts (trading away speed and
comfort for additional protection) is fairly obvious. Additional gear as
technology warrants. 06:14, 27 March 2009 (UTC)
