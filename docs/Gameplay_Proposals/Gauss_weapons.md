This is only a basic idea, but it might be worth pursuing. Obviously,
I'm using the name from X-COM:TFTD, which would likely have to be
changed before a final version. Gauss weapons would basically be plasma
weapons, human-improved by merging alien technology with human laser
tech. There are three ways in which these weapons could be viable.

- A more powerful laser powered by a plasma reaction (or by antimatter).

While maybe a crude approach, it's still an interesting one. The lasing
would occur in plasma injected from a reaction common to alien plasma
weapons. A coil (hence Gauss) would keep the plasma contained when it is
being used and direct it to a harmless ejection after it's used up. The
other two ideas:

- A plasma gun, in which the bolt of plasma is aligned and contained by
  using a laser beam rather than plastic containers.
- A laser-supercharged plasma bolt the laser would supply extra power to
  the plasma bolt for some distance enroute to target.

Either of the latter two could used, or both. They can be seen as a way
to lengthen the barrel of the plasma weapon, hitting the target at the
nearest possible distance (the plasma ball would continue to form until
it reaches the target when it fall apart). The most obvious improvement
would be in the pistol and rifle, which would get a distance upgrade.

Of course, the name 'Gauss' would imply some kind of magnetism working
here, so another possibility would be adding low-range/high-power
electromagnetic pulse weaponry resulting in the target being
electrocuted (lethally or otherwise), perhaps an ultimate weapon against
Ortnoks.

Obviously, all of these are purely sci-fi.
