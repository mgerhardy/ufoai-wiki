The game currently allows characters to wield two pistols or melee
weapons, but it doesn't allow the character to use both hands
simultaneously. This makes it rather pointless to dual-wield in any
situation other than a pistol and stun rod combination. Please allow
characters with identical weapons in both hands to use them
simultaneously. Perhaps the game could grey one hand out and when the
player has the character fire it would fire both weapons.
