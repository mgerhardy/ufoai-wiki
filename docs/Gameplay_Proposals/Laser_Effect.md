Currently the Laser weapons have a firing mode that fires a single shot
and a second mode that fires three shots. The names of the firing modes
imply that the Laser is actually firing a single shot for a longer
duration rather than a burst. It would be nice if a longer duration
laser effect could be added in place of the three shots.

I propose keeping the damage calculations as they are with three chances
to hit or miss, and just change the animation to a single beam that
fires for the length of time it currently takes to fire the three-shot
burst. The damage will the vary depending on whether the damage
calculations determined 1, 2, or 3 hits. This is believable because in
real life the target is moving (in the process of running, dodging,
etc.) With 0 hits the beam should visibly miss.
