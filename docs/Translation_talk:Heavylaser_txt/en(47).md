There will be no large-scale demolition in UFO:AI, so that has to be
changed to "strike", etc.

I'm not sure if comparing with the area-damage RPG is wise, since it is
explosive. So perhaps compare both to Laser Rifle and RPG?

From irc: heavy laser has no recoil as a laser, and so compensates by
being

`       a laser`

<Bandobras> in this case "heavy" is probably weight of weapon plus
battery and

`       the electric overload causing vibrations            [00:32]`

<BTAxis> Yeah, but it's still heavy, so you need muscles to keep it
aiming on

`    target.`

### Form

"...my team and I..." is not how a report would look like, this should
be replaced with "we" or "our team" or "my team", but why would this
report be written in first-person anyway?
