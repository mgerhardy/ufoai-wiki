Damn, I didn't do anything for a whole year. Which makes only me feel
guilty, cause it doesn't bother others, which isn't a problem, hungarian
isn't a very nice language for games anyways (lots of fantasy/science
fiction/translated fiction stuff sound weird and childish in my
opinion). Also, not that translating the game texts into a minor
language is a big priority for this project. I'm just generally ashamed
for being a lazy bum.

TODO: Check all articles in Research, look for incorrect Mail Headers.

Also, I should've thought about this waaay before: use sed files to
replace common mail elements (read: mail headers)
