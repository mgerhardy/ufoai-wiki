## SAM Site

The SAM site is an unmanned, expendable installation that can be placed
anywhere in the world to automatically engage detected UFOs with
surface-to-air missiles. It is cheap to build and highly useful, but its
camouflage is not very effective. Alien craft may detect the missile
launches and attempt to destroy the site once they find it. The SAM site
is sturdy but will succumb to repeated bombing. Missile reloads are
delivered free to our sites by UN forces.
