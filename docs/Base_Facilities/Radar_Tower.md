## Radar Tower

The radar tower is an unmanned, expendable installation that can be
placed anywhere in the world to boost our detection range. It is cheap
to build and highly useful, but its camouflage is not very effective.
Alien craft may detect the active scanning and attempt to destroy the
tower once they find it. It is recommended that radar towers be
protected with SAM sites.
