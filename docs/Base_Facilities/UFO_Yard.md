## UFO Yard

The UFO Yard is a camouflaged storage field for captured UFOs. It can be
placed anywhere in the world to store captured UFOs for dismantling and
research, and can transfer UFOs to other Yards. UFOs stored in a Yard
can be researched and/or dismantled from any PHALANX base with
appropriate facilities, but these activities proceed more slowly the
further away the UFO Yard is from the base.
