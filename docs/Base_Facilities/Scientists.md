Scientists are the manpower of your base's laboratories. They currently
(jan. 2012) do not have trainable skills or stats.

## Official Description

## Old proposed Descriptions

They have usually worse basic attributes than soldiers, with the
exception of the [mind](Skills/mind "wikilink") attribute.

Ideas: Scientist or medic on team is neecessary to recover stunned
aliens. Scientist is allowed to use any weapon, as if it was researched
(but without reload). Perhaps also make scientist necessary to recover
crashed ufo parts. If the scientist is killed or absent, only alien hand
weapons are recovered. --[Bandobras](User:Bandobras "wikilink") 09:01,

Ideas: Make the scientists able to interact with alien technology, like
locked doors, computers (for stealing data, implanting a virus,
hacking), disarming defence systems in alien bases and/or UFOs, etc.. of
course if the game will allow such interactions with the enviroment
