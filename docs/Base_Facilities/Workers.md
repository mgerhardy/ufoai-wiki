Workers are the manpower of your base's workshops. They currently (jan.
2012) do not have trainable skills or stats.

## Official Description

## Proposed Descriptions

They have usually worse basic attributes than soldiers, with the
exception of the [power](Skills/power "wikilink") attribute. Worker in
the crew can mend one armor each mission, if the soldier wearing the
armor comes back from the front line to the dropship. If this is not
used during the mission, the armor with highest damage is auto-mended at
mission end. --[Bandobras](User:Bandobras "wikilink") 09:05, 12
