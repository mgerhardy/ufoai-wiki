## Proposed Descriptions

They have usually worse basic attributes than soldiers, but somewhat
higer [health points](Skills/health_points "wikilink").

Ideas: Scientist or medic on team is neecessary to recover stunned
aliens. A medic is twice as effective with medi-kit, or perhaps even
allow the use of medi-kits only if medic is on team (he instructs on the
radio how to use it and helps with the hardest cases himself). Then
medikit should be available without research. Consider also the medical
bay on a dropship idea from sf, but perhaps having the medic as a member
of the team is cleaner. Also, when the ideas about dropping unconsious
instaed of dead, but loosing HP each turn are implemented, medics both
on team and in base will be much more valuable.

Idea: How about normal soldier are capable of healing (light) wounded
soldiers (e.q. up to losing 3 HP each turn), but only medics are capable
of healing heavy wounded (over -3 HP/turn) and to stabilize uconcious
soldiers (and prevent losing unconcius soldier during returing to base).
