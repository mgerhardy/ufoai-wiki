Became aware of the UFO: Alien Invasion project in January 2008. Huge
fan of the XCOM series up to Interceptor (I liked that one too, just not
as much), also liked the more recent UFO trilogy (Aftermath etc). So far
I have worked on translating the UFOpaedia to Greek and maybe adding a
couple of proposals. Would someday like to work on code
debugging/development for UFO:AI (but not likely).

Personal quote of the week/month/year: so many games, so little time.
