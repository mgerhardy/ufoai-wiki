## LCDs

------------------------------------------------------------------------

LCDs are drones that are controlled by soldiers on the battlefield.
These drones rely upon the user to give orders: in other words, a
specified amount of the user's TUs are "transferred" to the drone.

There would be several kinds of drone chasis(tracks, wheels,
helicopter,etc) and several drone weapons to fit on them.(UV weapons
won't fit. Infantry weapons, if modified, would.)

Each drone also has it's own vision range and move cost.
