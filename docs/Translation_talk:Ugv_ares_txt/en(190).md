Not present in 2.2.1. 2.3+ only?

They really should get the UGVs operational, I've been playing UFO:
Extraterrestrials lately and the vehicles featured in the game can be
really useful and i think that the addition of UGVs would be VERY
helpful in this game.--[BattleBen](User:BattleBen "wikilink") 04:08, 22
