**MD2** is the 3D-format used by the Quake2 engine and thus by UFO:AI as
well. We use some of the [MD3](MD3 "wikilink") Features even for MD2. We
have tags and we can define more than one skin for each model.

## Tools

There is a perl-script in our
[repository](Getting_the_source "wikilink") that lets you change the
texture-paths, the texture sizes & the number of skins (only upgrade)
inside the MD2-files:

There is also a script that lets you read out the tag files (next to the
md2 files) we use in UFO:AI:

You will need a perl distribution to execute those scripts. A good one
for Windows would be
[ActivePerl](http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/).
