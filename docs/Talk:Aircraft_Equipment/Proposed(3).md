The obvious one for me is a medium to long-range missile. Typically it
will be radar guided at distance (probably using an seperate radar/radio
system in the interceptor aircraft to "paint" the target. As it gets
closer it would switch to internal multisensors (ladar, optical, heat
guidance, electrical signal guidance as per anti-radar)

Another missile type, would require research of captured missile, would
be one that homes in on their particular signal emissions, therefore
never homing in on an Earth target. Maybe this could be a modification
to existing sensors , missiles.

As an aside, aircraft rarely mount armour. It's too heavy. Unless
phalanx can find some super-material that is both inceribly light and
strong. It just weighs the aircraft down, generally aircrafat just
armour vital sections, like fuel tanks, crew and engines, or just the
engine intake. Even the A10 warthog ground attack craft has no armour,
except for round the pilot, to which they refer as a steel bath-tub

The bombing of downed UFOs conception was rejected in proposals. Maybe
some of the moderators should move Underminer and Hearthseeker
air-to-ground bombs to "rejected proposals" section?
