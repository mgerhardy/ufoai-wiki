I tried to write a description of an anti-UFO bomb research in the same
manner that other research options are written. I also added what I
believe are the necessary research prequisites.

I imagine 3 different bomb technologies, each more powerful than the
last. The idea in my head is that bombs will be used to completely
eliminate shot-down UFOs, with more advanced bombs capable of
eradicating larger UFOs. I'll try to describe the other bomb
technologies soon.

I'd appreciate any comments/suggestions, especially from senior UFO:AI
members/developers. If you believe any part should be changed in order
to accomodate it into the UFO:AI world, feel free to change it.
