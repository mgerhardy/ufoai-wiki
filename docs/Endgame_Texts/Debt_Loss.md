You've gone too far into debt. There is no one left willing to pick up
the massive bills you've racked up. Dissatisfied by your poor financial
management, the UN has decided to remove you from command and
subsequently disbands the PHALANX project as an effective task force.

No further attempts at global cooperation are made. Earth's nations each
try to stand alone against the aliens, and eventually fall one by one.
