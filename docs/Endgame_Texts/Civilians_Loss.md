## Text

Under your command, PHALANX operations have consistently failed to
protect innocent civilians. Hundreds have lost their lives through your
inability to handle the alien threat. The UN, highly unsatisfied with
your performance, has decided to remove you from command and
subsequently disbands the PHALANX project as an effective task force.

No further attempts at global cooperation are made. Earth's nations each
try to stand alone against the aliens, and eventually fall one by one.
