## Text

Your sponsoring nations have reached the limit of their patience. Your
failure to satisfy them with your progress against the alien threat has
resulted in a vote of no confidence in you, forcing the UN to withdraw
all funding and support for the PHALANX project. The project can no
longer afford to stay operational.

No further attempts at global cooperation are made. Earth's nations each
try to stand alone against the aliens, and eventually fall one by one.
