## Text

You have lost your only chance to recover the information needed to
create a vaccine for the alien infection. Your researchers try their
best regardless, but what they manage to do is too little too late. The
infection spreads steadily across the entire globe until humanity is
reduced to a handful of terrified individuals, always on the run until
they are hunted down like animals and given their injection.

When the aliens are done, Earth is left a barren wasteland, and humanity
as a free-thinking species is extinct.
