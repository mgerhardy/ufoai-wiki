## Text

You have failed in your charter to protect Earth. Our home and our
people have fallen to the alien infection. Only a handful of people on
Earth remain human, and the remaining few no longer have a chance to
stem the tide. Your command is no more; PHALANX is no longer able to
operate as a functioning unit. Nothing stands between the aliens and
total victory.
