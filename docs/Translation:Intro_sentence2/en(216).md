Conflicts have gotten rarer near the end of the century as new
technology and universal health-care finally became available to the
third world. Even the fires of terrorism have cooled in the wake of the
Second Cold War, with its horrors and inhumanities still fresh in the
minds of the people, from the old United States to the ravaged Indian
subcontinent. Class struggles are ascending to the political battlefield
now that every nation is guaranteed fair representation in the UN, and
the global standard of living is slowly on the rise down to the most
impoverished corners of the planet. Countries have solidified,
stabilised around a restructured United Nations that successfully
polices the world governments. Fragmented clumps of smaller nations,
frightened at first by the vast power blocks accumulating around China
and the European Union, have banded together into powerful political
leagues of their own -- then found themselves with no neighbours they
could safely fight. For the first time in the history of mankind, there
is law and order across more than three quarters of the world.
