Nice that we have a new translator ;-) what about the งานวิจัย/Th alien
breathing and งานวิจัย/Th wave laser - i don't understand one word, but it
seams like you use full translated names (e.g. งานวิจัย/คลื่นเลเซอร์ต่อเนื่อง,
too)

so are the above given articles duplicates now and should they be
removed?

## po file

You are working hard to translate everything - good job (at least i hope
so, because i don't understand one word ;-)) you should try to create
the po file as described in the translation article - then i can sync
your work and add it to the new testinstaller. then you can review your
work in-game
