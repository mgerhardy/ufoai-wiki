Hola

Gracias por ofrecerte.

Mira, en los foros deje un mensaje de que hacer para ver cualquier
traduccion, aqui te la copio, espero la entiendas. Perdon por no
responder antes, pero igual hace tiempo que no trabajo en la traduccion,
pues las vacaciones de invierno se me acabaron y estoy muy ocupado con
los estudios.

Gracias nuevamenete; Serpentus

Hi to all again.

Ok, this is important (I think)! I've managed to load a translation even
if I dont have the system wide language package.... =D I use Linux, in
English, and installed the spanish system wide language, but couldn't
load the game in spanish T_T... SO, I tried to do something, and it
worked, I even managed to load the russian translation without having
any rusian packages installed in my PC =D

The thing I did:

Since the game loads this .mo:

/base/i18n/en/LC_MESSAGES/ufoai.mo

i simply got the spanish or the russian .mo and changed its name to
ufoai.mo and overwrote the /base/i18n/en/LC_MESSAGES/ufoai.mo and then
runned the game again, and walla, the game ran in the language I wanted
=D

maybe a programmer can manage to make an option on the settings of the
game to overwrite that file with the desired .mo and auto restart the
game... Or ask the user in what language does he want the game to run
before the game is lounched...

I haven't tried this on Windows, but in linux it seems to work fine =D
at least on my PC =D

Hope this helps in something! Maybe it could be an alternative...

By the way, how can I upload a file to the SVN? I would like to update
the spanish translation, couse my first release has a lot of spelling
mistakes.
