- Additional to the global list a 'per-click list' was implemented


e.g.: If multiple targets are in the same spot popup a list with only
these entries.

- Bugs fixed:

1.  Inventory slots somewhat off

2.  Error in options menu (sound)

3.  Screenshot command will crash in other than 1024x768...

4.  many others (TODO: Grab the list from bugtracker)

- new day and night versions for frozen, tropic and oriental themes (see
  [Random map assembly](Mapping/Random_map_assembly "wikilink"))
- extented the UFOpedia (new menu, more infos)
- New technologies in research.ufo
- Updated weapon and armor stats
- New and updated translations available
- light and heavy armored models for blue
  ([Antarean](Antarean "wikilink"))
- some more day/night versions for "normal" maps
- grenades, grenade laucher and plasma blaster that fire over obstacles
  no longer have hard-coded range
- some broken models repaired (export problems, probably)
