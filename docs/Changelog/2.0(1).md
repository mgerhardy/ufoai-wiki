## Changes since last released version

***Not yet released.***

Note: These changes also went into the next version 2.1. Since
development went a bit too fast :) we decided to skip a final 2.0
release and skip directly to [UFO:AI 2.1](Changelog/2.1 "wikilink").
Sorry for the confusion. -- The UFOAI Development Team
