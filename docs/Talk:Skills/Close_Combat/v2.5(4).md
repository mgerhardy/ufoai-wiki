I assume close combat is useful to have as a secondary ability, to
increase stun rod efficiency and to have something to fall back on on
prolonged missions where ammunition becomes a factor.

You mean melee? Yes, all you say is true. But close combat is also blade
throwing and pistol use. These are one-handed and so essential for
protection when you e.g. throw grenades with the other hand or use
medikit, IR, mines, etc. Pistols (especially akimbo) are quite effective
close- to middle-range weapons for urban settings. Essential for any
soldier with heavy weapons that enters a building or is ambushed from
behind (though some may choose two-handed sidearms (they fit into the
holser, but use other skill!) for increased firepower ). All close skill
weapons except kerrblade and stunrod fit into the holster and so are
usable instantly. --[Bandobras](User:Bandobras "wikilink") 16:23, 15

The code says this skill is related to speed and power attributes. I
guess speed is more important, while power is more important for heavy
skill. --[Bandobras](User:Bandobras "wikilink") 15:28, 10 September 2006
