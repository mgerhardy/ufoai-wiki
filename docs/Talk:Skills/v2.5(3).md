## Gory Details about Accuracy

The formula for weapon accuracy is the only one not strictly linear:

    GET_ACC( ab, sk )
      ((1.5 - (float)(ab)/MAX_SKILL) * pow(0.8, (sk)/50) )

where ab is the basic attribute (e.g., accuracy), sk is weapon skill
(e.g. sniper weapon skill), MAX_SKILL is 256, pow(b,p) is b to power p.
By the GET_ACC value one multiplies the spread angles that indicate how
much off target the shot goes. Therefore the higher GET_ACC, the worse
accuracy.

Let ab = 100 and sk = 50; then GET_ACC( ab, sk ) = 0.89. Let ab = 50 and
sk = 100; then GET_ACC( ab, sk ) = 0.83. This indicates that weapon
skill has bigger impact, as expected.

## Pilots

Is possible add \[planned\] pilot skills here too ?
