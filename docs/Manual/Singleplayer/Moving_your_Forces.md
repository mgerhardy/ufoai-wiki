The map on the [Battlescape](Manual/Singleplayer/Battlescape "wikilink")
is divided into squares. A character model typically takes up one square
to stand in. To move your forces simply select one of your characters,
either by clicking on them, clicking on the number in the upper part of
the screen or using the 1 – 8 keys. Then click on the square you want
your character to move to.

After movement a character will face in the direction his last square of
movement was. Right clicking on any square of the map will rotate the
active character so that he is facing there. The direction a character
is facing is important for [Spotting
enemies](Manual/Singleplayer/Spotting_enemies "wikilink").

Movement consumes [Time
Units](Manual/Singleplayer/Time_Units "wikilink") (TUs). You can only
move to squares that you have enough TUs to reach. When you hover your
mouse pointer over a square that is in reach, you will notice two little
numbers appearing over your mouse pointer. The first number will
represent the number of TUs it will cost your character to reach that
square. The number in parenthesis is the number of unreserved TUs your
character currently has left during this round.

**TU costs of moving:**

- Moving to a directly adjacent square uses 2 TUs.
- Moving to a diagonally adjacent square uses 3 TUs.
- Moving while the character is crouched (crawling) uses one additional
  TU (so that’s 3 TUs to adjacent squares and 4 TUs diagonally)
- Crouching or standing up uses 3 TUs.
- Rotating uses up 1 TU regardless of the number of degrees rotated.

*Example:* My soldier is crouched behind cover and I want to move to the
next cover which is 6 squares away (4 squares straight, 2 squares
diagonally). This will take up a total of 20 TUs (3 TUs for standing up,
14 TUs for moving there, 3 TUs for crouching down again).

If your soldier is currently crouching and you want him to be crouching
again after his move, you don’t have to do the standing up/crouching
manually. Just click on the spot you want to move to and the program
will automatically make him stand up, walk over there and crouch again,
if that costs fewer TUs than crawling there.

Be careful when moving in the enemy's field of vision, as this may
trigger [Reaction Fire](Manual/Singleplayer/Reaction_Fire "wikilink").

**Keep moving soldier!**
