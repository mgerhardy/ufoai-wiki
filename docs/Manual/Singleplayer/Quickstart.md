## Quick Start

### Initial base setup

At the beginning of the game you will need to setup a initial base of
operations. This is done from the
[Geoscape](Manual/Singleplayer/Geoscape "wikilink"), which is a map of
the world overlayed with the day and night information, along with other
relevant details.

Choose carefully as it could have an grave impact on your ability to
defend against the alien incursions. Click on the map to choose a
location. As of yet PHALANX does not see a reason to build bases on
anything but land, and this will slightly limit your choice.

Next you will be faced with your initial base. Basic requirements have
already been fulfilled and the deductions have been taken from your
budget. (Which includes buildings, equipment and personnel recruitment
costs.) In the upper right hand corner a button that looks like a set of
check boxes
<img src="CheckOptions.jpg" title="CheckOptions.jpg" width="32"
alt="CheckOptions.jpg" />. This button takes you upwards in the menu
system. From the building screen it takes you back to the geoscape.
Click it now. For a fuller explanation of the base screen see the
[Base](Manual/Singleplayer/Base "wikilink").

From the geoscape it takes you to the Load/Save screen . Click
"Continue" to get back to the geoscape.

Just underneath the ![caption up](CheckOptions.jpg "caption up") button
on the geoscape is the messages button (![caption
up](messagesbutton.jpg "caption up")). By default only the latest
message gets displayed under the title bar. By hovering the pointer over
the button all the messages are displayed.

To get back into your base and the interesting bits. Click on the Home
base ![Base Symbol](basesymbol.jpg "Base Symbol").

### Your first look inside a base

<img src="employessscreen.jpg" title="employessscreen.jpg" width="256"
alt="employessscreen.jpg" /> Lets go have a look at your team. Click on
the "Hire Employees" button.

The next screen has four options, Soldiers, Workers, Scientists and
Medic. Each option shows the stats for each of the groups.

You get a nice picture of your employees in the top right hand corner
along with there stats. If they are currently assigned to an aircraft
and provided with any armour they are assigned.

For now, *dev 2.1* ignores the stats for all but the Soldiers as they
are not applicable. The more of these backup crew the better as they can
work faster researching new technology, manufacturing equipment and
healing injured employees.

With the soldiers, despite the fact you can employ over 8 you can only
deploy a maximum of 8 per mission. The rest remain at the base, and can
be used to defend it should there be an attack by the aliens, or used to
replaced injured and dead soldiers in future missions. You employ an
member of staff by enabling a tick against them in the roster
[32px](image:checkedbutton.jpg "wikilink"). A cross
[32px](image:uncheckedbutton.jpg "wikilink") means they are kept on file
should their services be required in the future. *Note: New Employees
will be available at the beginning of each month*

Now lets leave this screen and go and look at the really interesting
section, arming our soldiers. Click the next button
[32px](image:next.jpg "wikilink") in the lower right hand corner

### Arming your soldiers

You should be back at your [base](Manual/Singleplayer/Base "wikilink")
view, and can now click on the aircraft option to look at picking a
crew.

[256px](image:aircraftscreen-firebird.jpg "wikilink") The first view
will be of the Firebird dropship. You can look at your other initially
issued interceptor, but for now it will not be used. Click on the
"Assign Soldiers" button to select which of the soldiers will be used
when the dropship is assigned to a mission.

[256px](image:assignsoldiersscreen.jpg "wikilink") At the moment all the
soldiers will be unassigned, and against each of them a cross. Click on
8 of the crosses to assign a full team. The team in counted in the
graphic of the aircraft chosen, which will also show the maximum that
can be carried. Once you have selected your team, click the next button
[32px](image:next.jpg "wikilink") in the lower right hand corner.

[right](image:equipment-screen-breakup.jpg "wikilink") You now are faced
with a screen divided into five sections.

<font style="background:black; border:1px solid red; color:pink;">(1) Red</font>
In the top left you have the selection of you active squad for the
aircraft you have chosen.

<font style="background:black; border:1px solid yellow; color:yellow;">(2) Yellow</font>
Next to this exists section exists where you can select different
categories of equipment. Due to the large amount equipment you troops
can use, this is helpful in breaking them into smaller choices.

<font style="background:black; border:1px solid blue; color:lightblue;">(3) Blue</font>
In top right you have a display of the currently selected soldier and
all his/hers assigned equipment.

<font style="background:black; border:1px solid green; color:lightgreen;">(4) Green</font>
The lower left contains information on equipment (object info) or the
solider (actor info).

<font style="background:black; border:1px solid purple; color:pink;">(5) Purple</font>
In the lower right hand corner, a pictorial representation of all the
equipment available for chosen category.

![](Equipmentscreen-assignment.jpg "Equipmentscreen-assignment.jpg") You
simply assign equipment by dragging and dropping the equipment to the
appropriate location. On picking up a piece of equipment the soldiers
will graphic will highlight, in light green, the areas to which you can
locate the equipment. Here we are assigning an Assault Rifle as the
active weapon to the soldier. As you can see it takes up a large amount
of storage space. However a hand can hold any sized item.

![](Assign-ar-mag.jpg "Assign-ar-mag.jpg")Now we assign a reload for the
Assault Rifle for when the soldier expends the preloaded magazine. This
spare magazine is alot smaller than the rifle and therefore we have more
options of where to locate the equipment. Here we locate it on the
holster, so it is in easy reach for reloads. We could have assigned in
to the belt with the vertical spacing allowed for this type of
equipment. *as a note the extension assignment zone is still work in
progress and will be added at a later date*

Once you have assigned weapons and equipment to all your soldiers you
are ready to go on your first mission.

Remember to give them armour and reloads for their weapons.

Exit from the Arming Screen by clicking the next
[32px](image:next.jpg "wikilink") button.

[right](image:aircraftscreen-firebird.jpg "wikilink") Back at the
Aircraft Screen, click the next [32px](image:next.jpg "wikilink") button
to return the base view.

To return to the [Geoscape](Manual/Singleplayer/Geoscape "wikilink"),
click on the Geoscape button

You now have two ways of speeding up time, either click the right arrow
next in the status bar , until the passage of time is in 1 hour slots
(this should be twice)

Within a short period your first mission should appear, and time will
automatically revert to the slowest passage of time.

### Entering a mission

Click on the cross, and you will get information about the mission,
which may aid you in weapon selection for your active team. Another
click on the cross, which now has a circle around it, will pop up a box
to select which of your dropships you will deploy. As you only have one,
there is but a single choice.

Choosing this dropship, will return you to the
[Geoscape](Manual/Singleplayer/Geoscape "wikilink"), and an icon will
appear with it's flightplan to the target. Once the dropship reaches
target you have one final chance to not proceed with the mission.

Clicking 'Enter' will load up the
[Battlescape](Manual/Singleplayer/Battlescape "wikilink") and enter the
mission.
