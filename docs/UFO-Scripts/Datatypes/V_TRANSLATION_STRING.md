## V_TRANSLATION_STRING

V_TRANSLATION_STRING translates the text which is enclosed in quotes.
The first char is **_** which will be ignored for translation but will
be needed for generating the pot-files for
[translations](Translating "wikilink"). It's also possible to use the
form **\*msgid:some_msgid**.
