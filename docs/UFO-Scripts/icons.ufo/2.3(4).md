The file `base/ufos/icons.ufo` contains all icon definitions. An icon
identify a named sprite displayed into some nodes, like buttons, tab,
abstractoption... An icon have a size and is displayed according to a
status coming from the "parent" node (normal, selected (hovered),
disabled, click (no used)). The description define how the icon will be
displayed according to this status.

Common information is the the image source of the sprite, the left-top
corner, and the size of the sprite.

## One sprite per status (default)

![](Icon_pack2.png "Icon_pack2.png")

All sprites is computed according to the image, the corner, and the
size. Normal status will use texl, selected status will use texl + 64,
disabled status will use texl + 128, and click status will use texl +
192. Then we can pack icons into a texture of 256x256 where texl.y +
size.y must be \< 64.

    icon skull_1 {
        image "ui/icon_pack2"
        texl    "80 1"
        size    "29 25"
    }

## One sprite for all status

All status will use the same icon. Then there is no constraint on the
texture size or on the properties.

    icon skull_2 {
        image "ui/icon_pack2"
        texl    "80 1"
        size    "29 25"
        single  true      // activate the blend mode
    }

## One blended sprite for all status

An only one sprite can be blended with a color. We can define one color
per status.

There is no constraint on the texture size or on the properties, but
sprite pixels should use pure black/white level with alpha. A pure white
color will be translated to the exact requested color, and a pure black
will be translated to black.

This icon will display a red skull when the icon is normal, a selected
green skull, and a disabled blue skull.

    icon skull_3 {
        image "ui/icon_pack2"
        texl    "80 1"
        size    "29 25"

        blend   true      // activate the blend mode
        normalcolor "1 0 0 1"
        selectedcolor "0 1 0 1"
        disabledcolor "0 0 1 1"
    }
