### Overview

This is a box of 6 25mm incendiary grenades. They are fired
electronically by a spark igniter inside the launcher's barrel. These
grenades are area-denial weapons, covering a large stretch of ground
with very hot flames that are almost impossible to extinguish. The
compound itself is a modification of a mixture that has been in use
since World War II; thermite, barium nitrate, sulphur and binding agent.
And thanks to modern miniaturisation technology, it will all fit into a
handy, lightweight 25mm shell.

These grenades are meant to be loaded into an HPGL Grenade Launcher.

### Recommended Doctrine

All soldiers equipped with grenade launchers should carry at least one
reload whenever they go out in the field. It is not advisable to send
our troops into combat without spare grenades.

### Addenda

None.
