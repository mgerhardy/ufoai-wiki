------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Overview

This magazine contains 30 rounds of 4.2x24mm pistol ammunition. It is a
double-column box design. The rounds are very small and have decent
penetration, especially when causing several impacts close to each
other, and they cause a great deal of tissue damage once they've
penetrated skin. They're designed to have very little recoil, but this
doesn't help the MP-699's accuracy very much.

The magazine is meant to be loaded into an MP-699 Machine Pistol.

### Recommended Doctrine

All soldiers equipped with machine pistols should carry at least one
reload whenever they go out in the field. It is not advisable to send
our troops into combat without spare magazines.

### Addenda

None.
