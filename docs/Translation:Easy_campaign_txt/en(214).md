This is a more forgiving version of the Standard Campaign. The aliens
will be less tough, UFO incursions will be less frequent, and you will
receive more new recruits to make up for combat losses.

This campaign represents the Easy difficulty level, and is an option for
first-time players who prefer smoother sailing than the Standard
Campaign might offer.
