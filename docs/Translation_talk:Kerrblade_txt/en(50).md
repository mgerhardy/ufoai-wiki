BTW, what Kerrblade stands for? Who did the model and who found the
name? Why were the original stats as they were?

Never mind. The current description is cool! :)

I took out the sliding over the armor parts, because it doesn't sound
right, given real physics. It'd just bounce off. Instead, I went for a
really, really sharp blade that is so effective that it can even pierce
advanced armor. I also made it almost impossible to manufacture, thus
building in a safety against bullets based on the same principle (too
costly).

OK. We use the idea that you can stab at armor joints already for the
other blades. It plays better with melee, whiel Kerrblade is throwing
mainly. Good work!
