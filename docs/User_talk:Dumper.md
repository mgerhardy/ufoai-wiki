Hi

i've just seen that you've updated the weapon list. we are searching for
a way to generate a statistic for our weapons and ammo in relation to
the armour and the damage. do you think you could maybe also write such
a script? it would help us to balance the weapons more.

Please contact [me](User:BTAxis "wikilink"), and we can discuss the
script formulas. --[BTAxis](User:BTAxis "wikilink") 20:33, 12 May 2009
