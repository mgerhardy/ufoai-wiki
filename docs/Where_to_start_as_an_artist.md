## Introduction

UFO:AI's world comes together through the contributions of artwork
across a range of formats. It's not always easy to know how you can help
when you're first checking out the project, so we've compiled this guide
to help you.

You may also want to check out our [Roadmap](TODO/Roadmap "wikilink") at
some time. It is a list of all the content we have planned for the game.

## I know how to...

### ...model, skin and animate in a 3D program like Blender, 3DSM, Maya and others.

- What we need most:
  - Aliens. We still have several planned aliens that are not completed.
    See [Proposals/Alien_Bestiary](Proposals/Alien_Bestiary "wikilink").
  - Civilians of all types to run around and be gunned down and/or saved
    on the battlefield.
- What we want:
  - Improved versions of existing alien and civilian models. We now
    support more polys, higher skin resolutions, etc.
  - UGV (unmanned ground vehicle) models. We are still in the early
    stages of integrating them, so please discuss in the forums first.
    Our [Roadmap](TODO/Roadmap "wikilink") sets out some more details.
- What you need to know:
  - [Basic Modelling Requirements](Modelling "wikilink")
  - [Character Animation
    Requirements](Modelling/Character_Animation "wikilink")
  - [Advanced Skinning Information](Artwork "wikilink")

### ...model and skin in a 3D program like Blender, 3DSM, Maya and others.

- What we need most:
  - Any weapon, aircraft, UFO or equipment models that are not marked on
    our [Roadmap](TODO/Roadmap "wikilink")
  - Crashed models of some UFOs and PHALANX aircraft. I don't think we
    have an up-to-date list of what we need, but please ask in forums if
    interested in doing this.
  - Civilian vehicles to be used in the battlefield as props. Should be
    slightly futuristic. Can be urban or rural. A few can look like they
    have crashed.
  - Occasional icons and other objects used on the geoscape (these are
    the small, simple models which indicate missions, bases,
    installations, UFOs and aircraft on the geoscape). Ask a developer
    if anything is currently needed.
- What we want:
  - Improved versions of existing weapon and equipment models. We now
    support more polys, higher skin resolutions, etc.
- What you need to know:
  - [Basic Modelling Requirements](Modelling "wikilink")
  - [Advanced Skinning Information](Artwork "wikilink")

### ...model and unwrap in a 3D program, but I can't skin very well!

Most of the time, we don't have people available to do the 2D work for
you. But in some cases you might find someone to help if your model is
good enough. Simpler objects are more likely to get help (weapons,
equipment) and you'll still need to put a basic skin in place. See the
section above to get started, and feel free to post in our forums to see
if anyone is interested in completing your model.

### ...create textures for 3D environments (maps) using Gimp, Photoshop or another program.

In most cases, we recommend you learn to make the maps yourself or find
a mapper and coordinate to provide textures they need. There is a large
store of open-source textures and texture resources a mapper will
typically draw from, so texture contributions that are not targeted to a
specific purpose are often not used. That said...

- What we want:
  - Animated billboard or advertisement textures for a large urban city
    (see /base/textures/tex_misc/advert\*).
- What you need to know:
  - [Handling normalmaps, specularity, etc.](Artwork "wikilink")
  - [Our material system (animation,
    etc.)](Mapping/Materialsystem "wikilink")

### ...draw, design, or otherwise create 2D artwork using Gimp, Photoshop or another program.

- What we need most:
  - All of our tech items, including storyline pieces, have a 2D image
    that is displayed in the UI. Check the
    [Roadmap](TODO/Roadmap "wikilink") under the Story content, as well
    as all other content, for unfinished items mentioning a "Tech
    image".
- What we want:
  - Improvements to any tech items. If we think your version is cooler
    than what we've got, we'll probably use it.
- What you need to know:
  - Not much, but you'll want to explore the existing content to make
    sure you match existing dimensions.

### ...map in a Radiant-like program used by games such as Quake.

- What we want:
  - New maps. Always.
  - New tiles for [existing map
    themes](Mapping/List_of_Maps "wikilink"). Learn about our [random
    map assembly mechanism](Mapping/Random_map_assembly "wikilink").
  - Maps for specific end-game battles. See the Storyline Battlescape
    Missions in our [Roadmap](TODO/Roadmap "wikilink").
- What you need to know:
  - [Introduction to Mapping](Mapping "wikilink")
  - [Mapping For Dummies](Mapping_For_Dummies "wikilink")

## I want to learn how to...

### ...make maps to hunt aliens in.

We use a variant of the quake-based map editor Radiant that we call
UFORadiant. Learning how to use this editor will allow you to create new
battlefields, something we're always looking for.

- What you need to know:
  - [Introduction to Mapping](Mapping "wikilink")
  - [Mapping For Dummies](Mapping_For_Dummies "wikilink")

### ...make weapons, vehicles or other objects for UFO:AI.

You'll want to learn a 3D modelling program, like Blender (it's free and
open source). It's complicated and you'll want to go through a lot of
tutorials to learn how to use it. There are loads of tutorials out
there. Proper modelling will often involve skinning as well (wrapping a
2D texture around the 3D model), so you'll also need to learn a basic 2D
image editing program.

- What you need to know for UFO:AI:
  - Once you've got the hang of your program and want to start doing
    something for UFO:AI, check out our [basic modelling
    requirements](Modelling "wikilink").

### ...make civilians, soldiers or aliens for UFO:AI.

You'll want to do everything in the previous section to learn how to
model and skin an object. Then you'll also need to go through some
tutorials on animation.

- What you need to know for UFO:AI:
  - Once you've got the hang of your program and want to start doing
    something for UFO:AI, check out our [basic modelling
    requirements](Modelling "wikilink").
  - Then: [Character Animation
    Requirements](Modelling/Character_Animation "wikilink")

### ...improve the UI or contribute artwork for research techs.

You'll need to get your hands on a good 2D image editor. We recommend
Gimp or, if you can afford it, Photoshop. Either will suffice, but both
are complicated programs, so you'll need to look at some tutorials to
find out how to use it.

- What you need to know for UFO:AI:
  - Not much. You'll want to look at the files for the game to make sure
    you are matching the same dimensions as other items.

### ...create textures to be used in battlefield maps.

You'll need to get your hands on a good 2D image editor. We recommend
Gimp or, if you can afford it, Photoshop. Either will suffice, but both
are complicated programs, so you'll need to look at some tutorials to
find out how to use it.

- What you need to know for UFO:AI:
  - [Handling normalmaps, specularity, etc.](Artwork "wikilink")
  - [Our material system (animation,
    etc.)](Mapping/Materialsystem "wikilink")
