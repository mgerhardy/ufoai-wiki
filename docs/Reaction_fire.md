If an actor from your team sees an enemy, when enemies turn is active,
and reaction fire is turned on, an actor can attack this enemy
automatically.

So, reaction fire is a fire that is made as reaction for enemy
appearance.

Who will fire first? The active actor or one making reaction fire? This
depends on the [speed](Skills/speed "wikilink") skill of each actor and
the TU needed to take a shot from the primary weapon of each actor.
