I propose that ammo goes over obstacles (like Grenade Launcher) but
explodes at impact, not after bouncing here and there. This fits the
plasma balls intuition. RPG-like behaviour is already planned for the
Tachyon Missile Launcher.

Change of plans to distinguish from Grenade Laucher some more: plasma
balls over obstacles and continuous beam as in plasma rifle.

## Inappropriate description: heavy weapon

- The following sentence leads to incorrect implications: *The blaster
  requires at least two people and a heavy-duty cart to get it in and
  out of secure storage.* Any thing as heavy as that can not, under no
  circumstances, be taken into battle by a single soldier, no matter how
  strong he is. Even if he is able to carry it along, he will not be
  able to aim and fire if it is a gun-style weapon. Additionally, after
  reading this sentence in the game, I thought that my soldiers would
  not be able to use that weapon at all. Not before the researchers
  found a way to mount it on a vehicle or something like that. This
  sentence is misleading, preventing players who carefully read the
  description from taking it into battle.
