Remaining bit of the description, so that we can remove alien_types.txt:

\[shevaar_autopsy_txt\] The sheer muscular bulk of the Shevaar is
supported by a stout, rugged skeleton, giving the species its fearsome
strength. The two sets of jaws are anchored on the creature's enormous
shoulder blades, making them as wide as the creature itself, and provide
phenomenal crushing force. The huge wet nose of the beast is in fact its
brain, covered with a dense array of sensory cells of varying types.
While the ability of the Shevaar to hunt down its prey is heightened by
this combined sensory and cognitive organ, its prominent placement and
lack of protective bone renders it susceptible to psionic attack, as
well as providing an obvious weak point in melee combat.
