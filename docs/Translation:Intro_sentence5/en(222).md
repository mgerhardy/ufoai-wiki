An emergency meeting of the UN provides no conclusive direction. The
incursions continue faster, larger and more savage than before, this
time in Bonn, Johannesburg and Bangkok. Some nations attempt diplomacy,
sending messages in a thousand different languages to the aliens
ravaging across the countryside. Their words are ignored. Within hours,
all three cities are emptied of human life. The attack is over by the
time the various militaries are given permission to strike back. The
aliens leave nothing behind them but concrete and blood. All the UFOs
disappear without a trace -- but no one doubts they'll be back.
