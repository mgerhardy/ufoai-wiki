# Description

UAAV is aerial version of UGV, that can be deployed to battlefield by
PHALANX troops. Like it predecessor, the UGV, it is operated from safe
distance away from the battle by a pilot. It is deployed the same way as
the UGV, but combines both auto-cannon (50 shots) and rocket launcher
(4-8 rockets). It is about 2/3 size of the UGV.

# Battle Implications

Its propulson is helicopter-like and uses standard fuel, so it does not
drain any anti-matter storage of the player. It is also fast moving (60
TUÂ´s), which allows the player quick armed reconaissance of the combat
area.

The armament can be upgraded with beam weapons (heavy laser, particle
cannon) and more advanced rockets.

It has its drawbacks though. Due to its heavy armament it lacks the
armor protection of the UGV and is more vulnerable. There is also an
upgrade drawback. As the unit operates in air and cannot change
magazines, the later version upgraded with beam weaponry will have small
amount of shot capacity due to large and weak power cells (laser 16
shots, particle cannon 12 shots). They have been twinned, but still the
output is not enough to provide more shots.
