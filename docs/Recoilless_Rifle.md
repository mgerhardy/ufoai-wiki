Proposal: A standard single-shot disposable AT weapon.

Description: A single-shot weapon designed to be used against armor in
urban environments. The center of the tube contains a propellant charge
set between two solid plungers. An 82mm HEAT round rests against the
forward plunger while a mass of soft shredded plastic of the same weight
as the projectile rests behind the rear plunger. Upon firing the
plungers push both from opposite ends of the tube, cancelling out each
others' recoil, while the plungers form a seal on either end and
contains the backblast from the propellant.

Pros: Lighter than rocket launcher, no backblast. Cons: Less damage,
less-accurate unguided projectile, single-shot
