Personally, I think the briefing should also be accessed from the icon
on the geoscape. This would allow the player to choose which team and
equipment to send ahead of time. Something else that would be nice is a
satellite overview of the area. This would be especially useful on
prebuilt maps, say in order to tell if you need snipers (like in the
Hydro Dam map) or if the region is urban. Satellite overview on
randomized maps seems a bit tricky, though. Perhaps the arrangement of
the map is calculated ahead of time, and a 2D overview is compiled
quickly from pre-rendered overviews of each map component?

**Mission descriptions**
*Terror missions*
The aliens are attacking the city of %s. Their objective is to kill her
citizens and demonstrate their power. This is a particularly
disadvantageous mission for PHALANX as governments are particularly
sensitive when their citizenry is so visibly in danger. Any loss of
civilian life will have a severe impact on PHALANX' public relations
with the relevant government, and the aliens know this.

*UFO recovery missions*
PHALANX fighters have shot down a UFO, which has crash-landed in this
area. Since the UFO was not destroyed we have to assume that the aliens
onboard have survived. There is every reason to exercise caution. If any
aliens survived, they will most likely try to destroy any equipment that
survived the crash to prevent us from stealing their military secrets.

PHALANX has detected a UFO that has touched down on the Earth's surface.
This is a good opportunity to capture an undamaged UFO for research. The
PHALANX drop ship is not known for its stealthy approach, so the alien
crew will be alerted to your presence. Expect organized resistance and
exercise caution.

*General seek-and-destroy*
PHALANX has received reports of alien activity in the area. Your squad
is to investigate these reports. Proceed with due caution. Although this
mission may not be crucial to winning the war, we can afford precious
few setbacks. Do not waste the lives of your men.

*First base mission*
DivInfo has located a hidden alien base. This base appears to serve as a
catalyst to the spread of the alien virus in this region. You are to
infiltrate this base and render it inoperable. PHALANX intelligence
currently has no detailed information as to the importance of this base,
we can only assume that they are at the core of the alien invasion. This
is where PHALANX really has to prove its worth.

*Generic base mission*
DivInfo has located another hidden alien base. As you know, the aliens
use these bases to coordinate and speed up the spread of their virus
among the human civilian population. For this reason, PHALANX can't
afford to leave these bases alone. It's your job to make sure this one
is put out of commission.

*Special base mission*
DivInfo has located another hidden alien base. You and your squad have
been given orders to infiltrate the base and salvage the so-called
Psi-Link you will find inside. PHALANX needs two of these Psi-links to
find the location of the source of the alien invasion. I don't have to
tell you that a lot rides on this mission, so look alive!

*Base defence missions*
The aliens have taken the fight to us. One of our bases is under attack,
and unless we repel the intruders we will be forced to abandon the
place. Needless to say, this is a scenario that PHALANX can ill afford.
Assemble your men and protect what is ours!

**Mission objectives**
*Terror missions*
Your primary mission is to prevent any civilians from being killed.
Every human life lost here today is a life we can't afford. Do whatever
it takes to ensure the civilians' safety. Kill or incapacitate any alien
forces present and secure the area. Return to base only once TacOps has
confirmed that no hostile forces remain.

*UFO recovery missions*
Your primary mission is to make your way to the crashed UFO and secure
it. Once you have accomplished that, proceed to eliminate or
incapacitate all remaining alien forces in the area. As soon as TacOps
declares all resistance neutralized, U.N. forces will relieve you and
you may return to base.

Your primary mission is to make your way to the landed UFO and secure
it. Once you have accomplished that, proceed to eliminate or
incapacitate all remaining alien forces in the area. As soon as TacOps
declares all resistance neutralized, U.N. forces will relieve you and
you may return to base.

*General seek-and-destroy*
Seek and destroy all aliens in the area. Kill or incapacitate any
hostile forces you encounter. If any civilians are present in the area,
ensure their safety first.

*First base mission*
Your mission is to eliminate anything that could be considered a direct
threat to your soldiers. This includes all alien troops, automated
defences and anything else you might find. Once the base is secure,
PHALANX engineer troops will salvage anything of use. Then a U.N.
demolition squad will fly in and blow the entire complex.

*Generic base mission*
Your mission is to eliminate anything that could be considered a direct
threat to your soldiers. This includes all alien troops, automated
defences and the psionic device. Once the base is secure, PHALANX
engineer troops will salvage anything of use. Then a U.N. demolition
squad will fly in and blow the entire complex.

*Special base mission*
Your mission is to seek out the Psi-Link, deactivate it without damaging
it and take it back to base. This will be a very dangerous mission, as
your soldiers will come under heavy psionic attacks as they approach the
Psi-Link.

*Base defence missions*
Your primary mission is to defend the base from being destroyed, or
worse, captured by the enemy. Focus on eliminating all hostile contacts
but try not to cause too much damage to our base. In addition, some of
our non-combat personnel have not managed to find shelter in time. Make
sure it doesn't cost them their lives.

**Terrain descriptions**
*Random map on the village tile set*
(day) You are deploying in an urban area. The use of heavily destructive
weaponry is discouraged as it could put civilians in danger. Consider
using houses, fences and cars for cover. Since you can expect the enemy
to be mostly inside the buildings in the area it would be wise to
include some short range weaponry in your soldier load-out, but do not
discount the opportunities for long-range combat the open street
provides.

(night) You are deploying in an urban area. The use of heavily
destructive weaponry is discouraged as it could put civilians in danger,
even at this hour. Consider using houses, fences and cars for cover.
Since you can expect the enemy to be mostly inside the buildings in the
area it would be wise to include some short range weaponry in your
soldier load-out, but do not discount the opportunities for long-range
combat the open street provides. Try to avoid streetlights as they make
your soldiers more conspicuous while not providing any sort of benefit.

*Random map on the tropical tile set*
You are deploying in a tropical area. Though the population density in
this region is lower than in most urban areas, there are still people
who have made their homes here. You can expect to encounter man-made
structures as well as natural terrain features. You will from poor
visibility due to heavy vegetation on this mission. Consider using
utilities for secondary detection.

*Random map on the oriental tile set*
You are deploying in a small desert village. The houses are built close
together, so you will have precious few opportunities at long-range
combat. Consider using close and medium ranged weaponry. Be conservative
when it comes to explosive weaponry as neutrals may be around every
corner.

*Random map on the frozen tile set*
You are deploying in a sub-zero area. Though your soldiers will have few
opportunities to camouflage themselves or take cover on this terrain,
the same is true for the enemy. Because of the sparse vegetation, you
should have a long line of sight. Consider using long-range weaponry on
this mission.

*Random map on the ice tile set*
You are deploying in a polar area. You will encounter neither vegetation
nor settlements here, but the chaotic natural terrain formations are
more than enough to hinder your visibility. As there will be no
civilians to worry about, you are free to use grenades and other
indirect fire weapons.

*Random map on the country tile set*
You are deploying in a rural area. The terrain here consists mostly of
barren ground and rock, decorated with the occasional cactus. As the
terrain provides little cover to both you and your enemies, consider
gearing up your squad for long-range combat.

*Random map on an industrial tile set, regardless the terrain type*
You are deploying in an industrial complex. You will encounter spacious
warehouses and silos as well as industrial machinery. As you will have
some room to manoeuvre, consider using explosive weaponry such as
grenade throwers on this mission.

**Intel**
*UFO recovery missions*
The aliens will not be sitting on their hands. They will likely take
steps to destroy their UFO. If they succeed in this, your mission will
be a failure. Do not take unnecessary risks, but work with due alacrity.

*Urban missions*
TacOps expects the aliens to field mainly weapons intended to maim and
kill. Expect the aliens to be mainly armed with plasma weaponry. Ortnoks
and Tamans are expected to be out in force, while Bloodspiders are
unlikely to appear in large numbers.

*Base missions*
This is a military installation. Expect heavy alien resistance of all
varieties. There may also be automated defences present. Keep your eyes
open for anything unusual. This base is a source of viral infection, so
there is a good chance you will encounter combat situations that are not
covered in the drills. Be advised that there is a possibility that you
will find hostile humans in your path. These humans must be considered
enemy forces. If at all possible, use nonlethal methods to incapacitate
them, but do not hesitate to shoot to kill if the situation calls for
it.

Expect heavy alien resistance of all varieties. There may also be
automated defences present. Be extremely wary of the psionic device that
must be present in this base. It is to be destroyed with extreme
prejudice. Be advised that there is a possibilty that you will find
hostile humans in your path. These humans must be considered enemy
forces. If at all possible, use nonlethal methods to incapacitate them,
but do not hesitate to shoot to kill if the situation calls for it.

*Special base missions*
Your mission will fail if you destroy the Psi-Link, but do not hesitate
to do so if your squad is in danger of being wiped out. There will be
more bases you can attempt this mission on. However, keep in mind that
time is not on PHALANX' side.

*General additional intel messages*
(when facing few aliens) We expect only minor resistance, and you should
be able to meet your objectives without taking casualties. Therefore,
this mission is a good opportunity to try and capture live aliens for
study and interrogation. Consider using nonlethal methods on your
enemies.

(when facing more aliens) You can expect the aliens to put up a fight.
Keep your eyes open and make use of any cover you can find. Focus on
thinning the enemy ranks first; only after you have gained the upper
hand should you attempt to take prisoners.

(when facing many aliens) The aliens are going to be out in force. Don't
field any half-measures on this mission, because you will need all the
firepower and protection you can get. It is a good idea to field at
least one indirect fire weapon as the aliens may be grouping together.

*Additional base defence messages*
(when there are live aliens in AC) Keep in mind that we currently have
live alien specimens in custody. We must assume the aliens are aware of
this and will try to free their comrades. If they succeed in doing so,
the situation will take a turn for the worse. It would be wise to
prevent any aliens from reaching Containment.

(when there are craft in hangars) Our vehicles are still parked in their
hangars. They make for an easy target for the alien troops and may well
be damaged during this fight. If the aliens manage to inflict enough
damage on our craft we will have to spend time and resources on repairs
before we can use them again. You should consider preventing the aliens
from taking pot shots at our craft, but remember that our craft will be
lost altogether if we don't win this battle!

(when there is an active power plant) Command has decided to keep the
power plant on-line. As a consequence, you should prioritise defending
that particular facility. If the aliens damage the power generator while
it's active, it could send the reactor into meltdown. This must be
avoided at all costs.
