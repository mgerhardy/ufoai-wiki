About the "Economy/Equipment" part, how about the equipement the squad
get from the ground/dead aliens on missions ?

I suppose they can't use it immediatly, but should be once PHALAX
researched its use.

I suppose it's possible, but I like the idea of keeping the game mode
streamlined. Not too much equipment/resource management. A less
important issue: it makes sense that Phalanx/govts would claim control
of alien technology retrieved on battlefield and would not let a
mercenary group tkae it. --[H-hour](User:H-hour "wikilink") 19:08, 20

Actually, on re-reading the proposal, it suggests it should work like
Darkoneko suggests. Equipment picked up during a mission can be used
(assuming it has been "researched", although most research progresses
without the player). Either way is alright, I think, as long as picking
up weapons does not become a major game mechanic. The player shouldn't
be in a position where he gains a lot by running around stuffing
soldiers' backpacks with weapons before a mission ends.
