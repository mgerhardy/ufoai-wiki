A single longer burst isn't the same as three shots. The three shots
have individual chances to hit, and armour applies to each of them if
they hit. In short, it would become a whole different fire mode.

I'd be happy with a longer beam effect on the other fire mode, though.

I see what you mean... I guess I was thinking of having the visual
effect of one long duration beam but still calculating the damage using
three shots. One might think of it as calculating the chance to hit,
armor penetration, etc. each second in a three second duration shot.
After all the target is supposedly moving. -- Trifler

Considering it's called Pulsed Fire, I don't see why several individual
shots would be wrong. In fact the entire concept of a Pulse Laser
fireing a single beam would seem very strange to me.

Actually, a pulsed laser can pulse on the order of fractions of seconds,
the exact number depends on how the laser is pumped. In addition, the
lack of recoil effectively nulls the difference between one 3-second
pulse and three 1-second pulses (or 3 0.75-second pulses).
