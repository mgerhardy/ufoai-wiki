"Aliens captured. This score depends on the number of aliens captured
alive, and the types of aliens captured. Capturing aliens is worth more
than killing them. Stunned aliens that can not be taken to base because
of a lack of space in AC are considered killed." -- tricky/impossible.
We don't know how many aliens we can handle in base before dropship
returns to base, because that value can change between the moment we
finished the mission and the moment we unload cargo/aliens in base (the
moment dropship returns to base) - more aliens can be transfered from
another base meanwhile, already captured aliens can be killed meanwhile,
and so on--[Zenerka](User:Zenerka "wikilink") 22:56, 28 August 2007

- Then either simply always award more points for stunning aliens (it's
  the effort that counts), or simply award the same points as for
  killing them (then the score won't change either way). I'm fond of the
  idea of being rewarded for doing things the hard way myself, hovewer.
  Enough for the fact that capturing aliens is stimulated through the
  storyline and research requirements as well.

it seems unfair to punish the player for civilians which were killed
before he could even reach them, because they were killed in the first
or second round. If a civilian has been killed in the first few rounds
it should be weighted less than a civilian which has been killed at the
end of the combat. for example by calculating the penalty with penalty =
min(1, (round-1) \* 0.25), which would make the first round weight in at
0 points, the second round at 0.25 points, the third with 0.5 and the
fourth with .75. After this the rounds will all bei punished as usual.
