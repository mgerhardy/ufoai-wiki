Two of these options (evacuating aircraft and killing confined aliens)
can already be done if the player realizes a base attack is imminent
before it actually occurs (at which point it would be too late to do
either of these). As for the power plant, it is a thorium reactor in
which the fission is accelerated by high energy particle radiation from
an emitter. It can't possibly 'go critical' from being damaged. An alien
could break into the reactor core and fire a particle beam at the
thorium pile, but probably wouldn't accomplish much beyond killing
himself.--[ChunLing](User:ChunLing "wikilink") 03:56, 19 June 2009 (UTC)
