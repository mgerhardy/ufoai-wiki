I'm not sure if "silicon steel" is a good material for such projectile.
Usually silicon is considered an impurity in steel alloy. The more
silicon in the alloy, the more brittle it becomes.

On the other hand silicon steel is used in construction of mains
transfomers, as it exhibit very low magnetic lossess due to saturation
and Eddy currents - this might be an advantage for a coil gun
application, though I'm not sure if the projectile hardness is not more
important than magnetic properties...
