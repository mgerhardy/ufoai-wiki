Do we really need a new model for the plasma-grenade shell? AFAIK we
already have one in svn. It seems to be a modification of the default
(frag) shell though. Which isn't generally a bad thing, since I imagine
the shape needs to still fit into the same weapon. --Hoehrer


See the related bug report on SF.

Hey. I think you really did a great job on all the emails from research,
very atmospheric. However about the particle weaponry, Cdr. Navarre
abruptly contradicts himself when he says that it is "miniaturised far
beyond our ability to duplicate", and yet most of it is "nothing that we
can't duplicate easily with enough money and effort". He is probably
supposed to refer only to the particle accelerator in the first part.
But for one he does not say that (e.g. "parts of it"), and for another
he cannot know, as the final research proposal clearly states that they
cannot tell what's inside the ammo source in the first place. Even more
so, the fact that it is impossible to duplicate is not certain prior to
completion of that very project. I'd suggest to remove the "beyond our
ability" part, or replace it with something less foresighted, like "not
understood".
