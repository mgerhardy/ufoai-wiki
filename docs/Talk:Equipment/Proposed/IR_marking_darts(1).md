It would be interesting to have some heavy support fire be able to hit
the tracked aliens. You wouldn't kill the alien directly when you shot
it, but a missile array on the dropship (optional install) could be
fired to destroy the alien. Maybe vehicles could also take advantage of
it. I'd like to think of orbital satellites firing heavy lasers on the
target, but chances are the aliens destroyed all satellites, and adding
space combat seems a bit overkill.--[Bobbens](User:Bobbens "wikilink")
