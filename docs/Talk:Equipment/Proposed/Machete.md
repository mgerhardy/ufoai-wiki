Hmm, interesting - I thig add it - it have bigger damage than knife, but
cost more TU to attack, and how about addind SAW (commongly used to chop
down trees and disloyal (false-hearted) wifes).

The idea isn't bad, but we should consider one thing: machetes are
usually very cheap and their quality is not too high. If PHALANX was
really hiring "hand picked" soldiers, couldn't it afford to arm them
with more sophisticated traditional melee weapons (sabres, katanas etc.)
or some form of vibroblade from "Terror from the Deep"?

Besides, player usually gets the opportunity to research kerrblades
early in the game...and these would certainly make machetes obsolete.
