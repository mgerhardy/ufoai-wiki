hmmm, but I think in year 2082 woul be more sophisticated tools for
treeschoping and others wood-works. And in terms of american farmers -
everyone have minimal one BIG gun.

In the 80's people I knew thought that by the year 2000 humans will
fight telepatic wars and own flying cars or spaceships. By the year 2080
axes will chop trees in the rare cases when lightsabers won't be
available. --[Sirg](User:Sirg "wikilink") 16:55, 28 September 2006
