Now, with the change to Particle Beam weapons (rather than Tachyon) and
the difficulty of maintaining an ammo supply, this would give a good
alternative that can actually be manufactured by humans but still give
the humans a decent amount of power. Plus, it creates a good
differentiation between the alien and human weaponry (Particle Beam vs.
Wave Beam weaponry). --[MNONE](User:MNONE "wikilink") 18:39, 8 February

## Technically this should be named maser

I think this is quite a good idea, but the name should be changed. Laser
is an acronym and stands for "Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission
of Radiation", which describes exactly what it does. Light is amplified
by stimulated emission. This can, of course, also happen with microwaves
(just another part of the EM-Spectrum). But then, it's "Microwave
Amplification...", so it's a maser and not a Microwave laser. In fact,
such devices have allready been built in laboratories.

Sorry, if anyone feels lectured. --[BaXiM](User:BaXiM "wikilink") 22:54,
