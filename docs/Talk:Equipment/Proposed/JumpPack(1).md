Perhaps the interface for the JumpPack could function through an
attached pistol grip off-hand control device. This could be a separate
inventory item which could be equipped and used like a grenade, only the
result would be the soldier moving on the plotted trajectory rather than
just a grenade. The greater control this would give to the player (and
to soldiers with high mind skill to improve jump accuracy) would tend to
make a separate Jetpack unnecessary in game terms.

Also, perhaps jumppack equipped soldiers could have an improved chance
of surviving a crash and transporting back to base?
