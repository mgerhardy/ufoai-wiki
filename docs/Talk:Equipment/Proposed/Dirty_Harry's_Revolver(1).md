Heh, good joke (souvenir rather than against ailen) , but I have nothing
against making revolver/pistol powerful weapon (flor pistol - e.q Desert
Eagle).

If people find my idea funny, than I wish this weapon to be a secret
unique item like an easter egg. It has one bullet left, but hey, after
you find it you can find hidden rounds throughout the missions.

May be is better to give civilians "right to bare arms" i.e. wide-spread
(at our time) .35 or .45 short-barrel revolvers? Not very effective
against aliens, but better than golf-club. And 12g shotgun can do the
job, or at least give civilian a chance. --[Eltar
