Suggest rename: "Stimulant injection"

Hmmm, interesing, but I thing accuracy reduction is to big (this is not
cocaine or something similiar). I thing - if is this special
battle-invented drug, then have no or minimal side effects (look at old
game BattleIsle : Incubation for Stimpacks), but will costly to
purchrase. And if you look at history - germans paratroopers used
amfetamine (or something simmiliar) in battle at Eben Emael (Belgian
fort) and this drug aloww them to fight for two-days without rest and
fight good. But after battle they get "extra exhausting points".

I think this could be very useful, but the effects should be iproved.

I suggest, that the usege of such a drug mix could double the TUÂ´s,
decrease the mind and acuracy by 20% and provides 20 more hitpoints (the
affected soldier does not feel pain and has bigger injury endurance /
resistance). After each mission the stimpack has been used will be
health care at the base hospital needed.
