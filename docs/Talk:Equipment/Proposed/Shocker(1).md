Existing background suggests that the aliens are able to collect enough
human specimens without resort to non-lethal devices (at least some
humans will lapse into an unresisting fugue state in response to
prolonged extreme stress, such as being suddenly subjected to combat
conditions without any effective means of self-defense, so this is not
unrealistic).
