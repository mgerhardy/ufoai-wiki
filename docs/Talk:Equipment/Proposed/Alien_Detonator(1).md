This would seem pointless unless the aliens did it fairly consistently,
which would make the game really hard.

## usage

I think it could be usable, let´s say for the alien commander, who´s
knowledge could be exploited by the humans :) Also it can be used for
suicidal attacks by humans, affected by the alien virus. Just imagine a
map, where civilians under control by the aliens attack Phalanx soldiers
by blowing themselves with suicidal plasma grenades belts to hell near
them....
