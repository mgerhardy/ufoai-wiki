Is there actually a view range limit in the game?

Yes, there is. E.g. Bolter Rifle has longer range than the view range.

## binoculars

I think the binoculars are rather useless, because there is already
support for IR goggles, which could also serve as binoculars. With time
the binoculars will be just an other useless item in the inventory list,
being replaced by goggles. See the proposed battlescape headset.

IR goggles are for night/insides situations. How about if binoculars
would expand viewing range, but impair close-combat abilities?
