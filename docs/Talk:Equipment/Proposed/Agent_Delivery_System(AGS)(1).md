It seems like special rounds for the grenade launcher could accomplish
all of this. I think that having more different types of 25mm grenades
would be good, particularly a CHOKE version.

Sometimes you don't want to use grenades, like a terror mission, or
possibly can't, like a claustrophobic base, because the area effect or
inherent inaccuracy are detrimental. This weapon provides similar, if
weaker, but more accurate effects as a direct fire weapon without the
area effect.

Combine this with a fast-acting load of [Grey
goo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_goo) and you have a very
dangerous weapon. [Supermagle](User:Supermagle "wikilink") 13:18, 6 July
