I think the maps in UFO:AI are too small to warrant a mortar weapon.

## battlefield vs mission

This is a battlefield weapon for large scale conflicts. In ufoai the
missions are small scale get-in-quickly-get-out-quickly operations.
Therefore no cannons, airstrikes, tanks and the like.

I think that this weapon would be useful in-game and realistically
(light mortars are frequently used to off-set force disparity between a
lightly equipped strike force and their target), but worry that it may
be difficult to implement given the ballistics exceeding the map height
(don't know whether that's actually a concern at all). The proposed
interface also seems overcomplicated, simply make the entire firing
sequence a single action. Otherwise I think it's definitely on my wish
list.

Alternatively, it might be reasonable to posit a futuristic heavy
grenade launcher which would basically be a super-light mortar. It would
have a large but not unlimited range, heavy projectiles (both bulky and
high-damage), and a single fire mode compared with the multiple modes of
the standard grenade launcher.
