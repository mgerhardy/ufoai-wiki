To be honest, this kind of weapon would require soldiers to have
additional bow skill - otherwise it would be unrealistic.

Unlike firearms, bows (like many traditional weapons) require years of
training to give satisfying results. Besides, alien armors seem to
protect against that kind of projectiles - I don't think this weapon
should be used by PHALANX soldiers.

It could become civilian weapon however.
