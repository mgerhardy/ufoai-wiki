The info for the exisiting sniper rifle already describes it as an
anti-material rifle.

It still is very unbalanced weapon. But... if add one shot fire and need
to crouch and deploy weapon before shot? -

That would be ideal. The description of the existing sniper rifle seems
to expect a bit much of a sniper rifle, and a bit little of an actual
anti-material rifle. An anti-material rifle would be obscenely powerful,
and realistically so, but it would be balanced by the necessity to at
least crouch, and it'd be impossible to fire more than one shot per
round with it. Reload should be a bit of a pain too, the material fired
is very heavy. It'd seriously slow down one carrying it.
