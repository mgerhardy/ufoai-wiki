In terms of gameplay mechanics this is already covered by allowing the
soldier to equip a melee weapon off-hand to deal with a sudden close
encounter of the unpleasant kind. And despite the training that they
foist on new recruits, it isn't a realistic (or safe) combat tactic to
use with a loaded weapon. It's really just an excuse for pugil-stick
training, which is more about building fighting (and team) spirit than
practical combat skill. I can't imagine hitting a dangerous enemy with
the butt of a loaded weapon for any reason, it's something you'd only do
to a basically defenseless opponent after you'd carefully safetied your
weapon.
