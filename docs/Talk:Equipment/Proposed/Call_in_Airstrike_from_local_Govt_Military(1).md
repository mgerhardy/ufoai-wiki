This might not fit with the idea that PHALANX is a super-secret
organization that is only called on when the local military cannot
respond to alien activity. It also might not fit into the short, sharp
tactical engagement model of the ground missions (if one thinks of each
turn as representing perhaps a minute or less of time).
