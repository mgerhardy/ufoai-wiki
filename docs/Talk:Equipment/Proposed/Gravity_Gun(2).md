Hmmm, first when i read Gravity gun, I think - this will be similiar to
GG in HL2 -and this will be lots of fun. --194.108.217.125


Nope, according to the proposal text it is nothing like the one in HL2
but rather a variety of a 'generic energy gun' or somethign along those
line. --[Hoehrer](User:Hoehrer "wikilink") 19:02, 1 January 2007 (CET)

@Original author: No gravity altering devices are used by aliens or
humans - same goes for ship-engines and FTL stuff.
[Winter](User:Winter "wikilink") talked quite a bit about these things
in the forums. If you really want to use a gun with these
characteristics i suggest a name-change (and consulting with winter).
