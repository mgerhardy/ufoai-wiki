A magnetic field would be more effective against plasma and particle
weapons than conventional weapons, even if those weapons used magnetic
material in their rounds. A lead projectile has such poor conductivity
compared to mass that it would probably just melt rather than slow
appreciably. That would actually cause it to do a lot more damage rather
than less. It's also worth noting that the alien wouldn't be readily
able to fire any advanced weapon from inside the field either.
