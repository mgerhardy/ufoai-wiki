Skills for mines? --[Bandobras](User:Bandobras "wikilink")

close i would say - explosive may be good, too but we can also introduce
a new skill type for mines

What would they affect? --[Bandobras](User:Bandobras "wikilink")

I wonder for some time already what to do with soldiers with bad
accuracy skill (except fire or train). Melee combat is an options, mines
might be another, unless the soldier has puny mines skill... Perhaps
link mines with the "close" skill so that if a soldier has low accuracy
but hight close skill he is still quite good as a scout with mines,
blades, medikit (if good mind skill), and even a shotgun for that alien
3 steps away. Then, of course, soldiers with low accuracy **and** low
close skill are total wimps... --[Bandobras](User:Bandobras "wikilink")

Another idea: link mines with mind skill, as for most of other misc
equpiment, so that mind is useful in the early game. But make power
skill affect close and heavy weapons so that accuracy is no longer so
important... --[Bandobras](User:Bandobras "wikilink") 18:35, 14 July
