Shock damage is proposed for this grenade. It could stun mechanical
beings, disable weapons for one turn, harm biological beings.

Maybe some ideas for the official description can be found here:

It would be more realistic for the damage to non-electronics to be a
result of the collateral effect of the shaped charge used to initiate
the pulse effect. There would be no detectable effect on conventional
weapons or biological material from the EMP itself, or it would damage
electronics far more than disabling them using conventional weapons
would. An EMP strong enough to cause current flow in biological tissue
or mechanical effects in conventional weapons would tend to tend to
vaporize sensitive circuitry and semiconductors rather than simply
disable them. It would also require a very large conventional energy
release, with significant collateral damage.
