May I propose a "Rejected Proposals" subsection? Possibly with half-line
explanation for each, so that people will know by example what not to
propose. Morever, whether the proposals where jokes or badly designed or
just not fitting with UFO:AI setting, their authors surely meant not
harm, so why not honor them by leaving their stuff, but in the "Rejected
Proposals" subsection?

Winter, if you feel there is too much unneeded work going into equipment
section, which is probably true now that you took over desctioptions
(thank you!), I would rather propose to change the Equipment section
heading, so that it's clear that total rewrites are no longer needed and
new suggestions have to be in accord with the setting (where is it
described, by the way?). The same for TODO section about creating
writing...

A bin for rejected proposals might be a good idea, yeah. Not too sure
about explaining the reasons why, since it takes time and there may be a
lot of suggestions incoming in the future. However, if you'd like to
create such a section, I'll use it.

As for unneeded work, proposals really are welcome, but they have to be
useable. Jokes and references are not. They don't fit, and most of the
time they're just really lame. As for real-world weapons, they could run
into copyright issues, and regardless there are going to be VERY few of
today's weapons still in use 80 years from now.
