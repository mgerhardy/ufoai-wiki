I'm in favor of this proposal. Aside from the fact that it will be
easier to maintain for mappers (and maps are a real mess, tbh), it will
also improve consistency across all of our poorly maintained maps for
things like bouncefraction, which actually makes a really big difference
in-game. Finding out you've misjudged the likely bounce behaviour of a
piece of ground can really ruin your plans.

While I do agree that current system should be revised, I do not agree
whith the proposed method ... and the wording to some extent. Yes,
having global directory of materials would be much better than the
current mess, but 2-level hierarchy coulkd create problems. For example,
you could have about 50 concrete materials differing only by texture --
and the proposal will require much more definitions than needed.
Multi-tier hierarchy could be better

Also, please call them "materials", not "textures". Texture is the
property of material, not the reverse. [Sandro](User:Sandro "wikilink")
