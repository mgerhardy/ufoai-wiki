I originally suggested this as a way of dealing with, the problem of
representing an entire PHALANX base, but why not have an alien base take
several tactical missions? Overall the arguments are similar. By taking
the base in several sections, you can represent a larger base without
straining the engine, you can have a partially successful mission
pull-back while still impairing base function, you can add variety by
giving each 'phase' of the mission a specific objective (secure alien
hangers and access, clear alien quarters, disable power plant, final
assault), and so forth.--[ChunLing](User:ChunLing "wikilink") 03:45, 19
