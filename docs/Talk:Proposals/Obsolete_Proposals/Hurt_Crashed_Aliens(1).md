yes - should be easy to manage - i thought of a feature like that, too.
spawn the alien and directly after spawn, set it to ent-\>state =
STATE_DEAD or STATE_STUN and HP to 0 -[Mattn](User:Mattn "wikilink")

that was implemented for crash sites, with this formula: each alien
has - 5% severe wounds (HP=5, STUN=50), else - 15% light wounds (HP=50%,
STUN=30), else - 30% stun damage (STUN=75)
