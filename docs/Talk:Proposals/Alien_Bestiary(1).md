### Alien Diversity

I think it would be a good idea not to add any more aliens like taman,
shevaar and ortnok. All three are able to carry all alien weapons and
wear light/medium alien armor, reducing their uniqueness in terms of
resistances/attacks. I would suggest focusing now on aliens that have a
dedicated type, like bloodspider, a combat flier, tanks, breeders, etc.,
all of which have just one weapon type and one set of resistances to
damagetypes. The diversity is good, I think, and any more
taman/shevaar/ortnok types will reduce the diversity.

### "Ghost" Alien

I thought about an alien support unit named "ghost" (or evocating it),
which would give the aliens a chance to get healed. In brief, here would
be this unit characteristics :

- Move type : *sliding*
- Action 1 : *healing (at distance) (reaction fire type)*
- Action 2 : *send a regroup order (at distance) (reaction fire type)*
- Behaviour related to action 1 : *healing if other aliens at range,
  moving towards the closest aliens if none immediatly at range*
- Behaviour related to action 2 : *if attacked, flees, sends a call to
  aliens so that they defend him*

### Bio-Mechanized Spider-like and jumping Alien

This unit would multiply the alien ability to travel over roofs and
streets making the outside battleground resolutely unsafe. It is
expected to alternate patroling at hi-speed at ground, and jumping. As a
half-mechanized unit it would wear a heavy armor. In return, the beast
should only deploy his weapon at a serious TU's cost (eventually
deploy+attack = 2 turns) and should be subject to disorientation when
panicked. Unit characteristics :

- Move type 1: *walk (to cover the map)*
- Move type 2: *jump (possibly over some buildings)*
- Attack : *Fire - eventually incendiary -eventually piercing (direct
  fire) (no reaction fire)*
- Behaviour related to Attack : *Stop moving for (big)gun deployment
  before fire.*
