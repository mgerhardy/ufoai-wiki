## Why a mode

cant people just do it themselves --[Rioting

I agree with pacifist. If someone wants to play the game hard way, why
does he/she need a special mode? Maybe sometimes someone with weak will
could be tempted to break his own vow and load his game, but I think it
is his own problem.

So unless we plan to do some sort of competitions and Internet score
registering, this feature isn't necessary.

Riker's thoughts: I dislike only one thing about the idea - why saves
before the battle assume that a player loses the battle? what if it is a
really important battle and the player just has to go afk because
something? I would be really angry, that's why I suggest the "Warhammer
40k Chaos Gate"'s Mighty Hero mode, where this one save was also used
during tactical missions (and that's the only reason why I think saves
during tactical missions should be available - for that hardcore mode).
During missions the game would be saved whenever the player looses a
soldier or a civilian is killed or another unfavourable (for player)
event occurs, like an artifact that was supposed to be defended is
destroyed, or live aliens in alien containment are freed, or the VIP is
killed etc. This way one won't have to worry abour possible real life
events and would have even more hardcore gameplay.

Long story short, I'm against the Ironman mode as proposed, but I'm for
it as long as battlescape saves are enabled in a way described above.
