## UFOPaedia

Hello, im new here, so sorry if i dont use very well this wiki. I just
have a little comment about the UFOPaedia GUI. The scroll on the left
side look unnatural, it will improve the "usability" to move it on the
right side of the text. [Bayo](User:Bayo "wikilink") 15:24, 10 September

## Basescape

I am not sure about the position of the transfert button. We can
transfert equipments (and aircraft? aliens?), so a better position is
with all buttons "buy/sell", "aircraft"... Recruit button position is
very well. [Bayo](User:Bayo "wikilink") 16:45, 10 September 2008 (UTC)

Are the drawings here final, has there been some consensus about them,
or are we free to comment and present alternatives to the ones listed?
