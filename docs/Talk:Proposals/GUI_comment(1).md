## Production

2.2.1 <http://ufoai.ninex.info/forum/index.php?topic=2948.0> : The UI for production isn't as intuitive as the one for research. On one occasion I wanted to build five small items each with a 26 hour lead time, with 10 engineers available. But after a month they hadn't started, and according to the UI I had 10 engineers available. I can't see an option to specify how many engineers to assign. Oddly, if I build a component through the option in the Aircraft Equip menu, it does get built.
(Personally, I would rather have a single interface for all production, and simply categorise the item list).

## Research

2.2 <http://ufoai.ninex.info/forum/index.php?topic=2218.0> : The 'Research' screen in baseview: In the version i played, allocating more scientists felt very unintuitive. Adding scientist to a project was done by pressing the "\<" button, instead of "\>". I'd prefer arrows pointing up and down. Up for increasing, down for decreasing number of scientists. By looking at the 'Start Research Project" buttons, I realize it isn't finished. Perhaps put a UFO-Paedia window in the rightmost frame with scientist/labspace numbers?

? <http://ufoai.ninex.info/forum/index.php?topic=1388.90> : I agree with everybody who says that the image of the finished research should NOT be displayed before research is finished. It just does not make sense in most cases (there are exceptions to everything) so see something you don't know about yet (crystal ball anyone?). So I think we can solve this in 2 ways:
\* Display no images at all and/or use a dummy "Unknown Tech" image.
\* Create custom pre-research images.

custom pre-research images with some generic unknown tech image where
those are missing seems to be the most sane way. if the code will be
there, images will start appearing one by one.

New UI <http://ufoai.ninex.info/forum/index.php?topic=3009.msg20603#msg20603> :"Research" UI. Would it be possible to indicate the total laboratory room in each base? Perhaps including a new icon (for example, a microscope) to identify this figure, at the same height than the names of the bases, and at the right of the two already existing icons with figures?

## Storage

2.2 <http://ufoai.ninex.info/forum/index.php?topic=2218.0> : Storage screen. I'd love to have a list of all my assets, so I can be sure when my captured UFO has arrived Smiley.

## Statistics

2.2 <http://ufoai.ninex.info/forum/index.php?topic=2218.0> : Statistics: I can never get enough of them, I'd love to see more of them, especially interception-stats.
--Luceat

## Buysell

2.2.1 <http://ufoai.ninex.info/forum/index.php?topic=2898.0> : It isn't really necessary to transfer stuff between bases, it seems, because you can transfer it instantly by selling it in the old base and buying it back in the new one. AFAIK this nets in a zero loss of credits, and the things are there instantly, same for personell, just delist and enlist it.

Please, don\`t forget about other languages. currently see two problems.
If tabs will be fixed width, i/e/ russian texts will overflow that
containers. If it will be dinamic, width of tabbar will not be enougth
to contain all tabs. [Kildor](User:Kildor "wikilink") 15:55, 17 October

Its true, that why, here (for the buy/sell window), it maybe more
interesting to use a dropdone list instead of a tab (what we also can
see on the preview (1')). Anyway, the tab i code use a dynamic width
(use the size of the text it need to display).

## Personnel

2.2.1 <http://ufoai.ninex.info/forum/index.php?topic=2898.0> : A request: there should be simple up/down or plus/minus buttons for hiring non-soldier personell since it doesn't differ in ability at all, and for stuff you plan to ship in the Transfer screen. And some way to sort soldiers by a skill you select, like the best in a specific firearms. And/or simple up/down buttons for the soldier roster, so I don't have to click on all of them when I look for good new candidates from the new recruits that have been sent to me.
--kh

<!-- -->

New UI <http://ufoai.ninex.info/forum/index.php?topic=3009.msg20603#msg20603> :"Basescape" UI. Could you also display the remaining free room for new recruits in the upper-left corner? Maybe including the total figure of current recruits just beside the "PERSONNEL" header, while adding a text line named "BASE CAPACITY" or something similar to display the current total room of the base (being placed in the "base name" box, in the "personnel" box or as a different boxt located between both of them). Or maybe an alternative way...

## Comments

I especially like the production and the hire employees proposals - nice
work. --[Mattn](User:Mattn "wikilink") 19:15, 26 September 2008 (UTC)


Thanks. We dont see, but i send a long time on the "production". If you
see a lack (or problems...) somewhere, i will be very helpfull to find
realistic/usable solutions. [Bayo](User:Bayo "wikilink") 07:27, 29

This may be more of a gameplay issue, but I think that it's not very
realistic to allow firing personnel at all. This is supposed to be a
hyper-secret project, after all (leaving aside that, without a
recruitment cost, it's easy to avoid paying anyone at all). It doesn't
make sense to take the risk of having lots of ex-employees of PHALANX
walking around. I thought the entire point of limiting the pool of
available recruits was because it takes time to secure the necessary
clearances for an entirely new level of secrecy in the first place.
Since, world-wide, you have such a small pool of talent that can even be
trusted to know that the project exists, it hardly makes sense to allow
any of them to be fired.

A comment somewhere in the UFOpedia about the reasons might be useful,
but eliminating the option to fire anyone shouldn't be hard. In the
recruitment screen, you simply display only personnel that are off-base
rather than including those at the current
base.--[ChunLing](User:ChunLing "wikilink") 04:30, 19 June 2009 (UTC)


Hello. If you dont like firing, we can kill them :-), the result is the
same: remove this people from my base besause (i dont need him; i need
space for another people; i dont like him...) You need to manage the
amount of people on your base. [Bayo](User:Bayo "wikilink") 08:42, 20

## Production - Buy/Sell - coherence

actually in Production screen increase buttons are on the right side, so
right stands for "get it". In Buy/Sell right side stands for sell -
perhaps the button order/meaning should be changed. Other ideas to make
it more clear:

- having increase/decrease be top/down
- add icons for +/- on buttons

Thank for your comment. That's right. I create [:Image:Proposal Base
Production.jpg](:Image:Proposal_Base_Production.jpg "wikilink") after
[:Image:Proposal Base
Buysell.jpg](:Image:Proposal_Base_Buysell.jpg "wikilink"). It's a better
thing to update the buy/sell as you say; and we can add a separation
line between "what you have" and "what you can have". It also can help a
little to understand where is the number of "what you have"
(instinctively, the number near the +/-). [Bayo](User:Bayo "wikilink")

## Widescreen

Request <http://ufoai.ninex.info/forum/index.php?topic=2936.msg19953#msg19953> : One quick thing - if someone designs a new GUI, would it be possible to make it more compatible than the current one with widescreen displays? With the present one in the SVN, everything is stretched out / scaled horizontally on my new computer (which has a widescreen display) out-of-proportion.
