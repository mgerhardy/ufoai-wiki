Something to consider: this text suggests that we can't use AM in our
other weapons. Do we like that idea?


Yes, I like this idea. I do not like "Antimatter Rocket" as we do not
have destructible environment. Also, I do not like any big-explosive
guns at all, it will be overpowered, or improbable weak by balance
reason. --[Kildor](User:Kildor "wikilink") 04:21, 15 May 2012 (SAST)
