I think having "reaction fire (RF)" is useful in a tip. BTAxis just
removed "(RF)". I think it is better left in. On several occasions, on
multiplayer, I have so start by defining my abbreviations using chat. It
would be better if beginners could absorb the common abbreviations from
the tips.

I really don't think you need to include the abbreviation. People who
are familiar with the term Reaction Fire are smart enough to know what
RF means. Putting it in the text like that makes it sound like it's some
official terminology, which it isn't. In every official text, we will
use "Reaction Fire", not RF. --[BTAxis](User:BTAxis "wikilink") 20:00, 5

while we are at it: defining TU, HP etc would also be useful.


TU is something we do use. Defining it is something for the manual,
though, not the TOTD. HP I can't recall ever seeing used in this game,
but maybe I just wasn't looking. --[BTAxis](User:BTAxis "wikilink")

I generally support always writing the full words with their common
abbreviation/acronyms next to it in brackets (see examples below). This
may not look good, but as Blondandy already said it helps explaining
things to beginners and indirectly define what abbreviations/acronyms to
use.

Common acronyms:

- health points (HP)
- armour points (AP)
- time units (TU)
- reaction fire (RF)
- fire mode (FM)

Capitalization of the original names is up for discussion, but since
these are generated names for special things I think making them upper
case would be a good idea as well IMO

I'm good with HP, AP and TU. But RF and FM? No. Ingame we don't
abbreviate them, and there's no reason to do so.

In multiplayer I use RF and FB for flashbang (and all of Hoehrer's
list). very handy for team chat. I am not the only one (though I can't
recall who I learnt it off). --[Blondandy](User:Blondandy "wikilink")

Chat is **not** official game text. You use the abbreviations because
it's less typing. We are not going to use abbreviations for anything and
everything just because it makes chatting easier - that's your own
prerogative. The reason why I can accept AP, HP and TU as official
abbreviations is because these are things with a value. They're
informative statistics, and it is useful for the player to have as
little as possible to read while still getting all the information. You
don't want to see "Time Units" 5 times in a row when selecting a fire
mode. But "Fire Mode" is not a stat. It's a description, a label, and
there is every reason to make this verbose.

Hm, that's a valid point, we only use **HP**, **AP** and **TU** in the
game itself (as far as I checked). These should be explained/used, all
the others do not have reason to be.

We could define them in another place, but the tips of the day are
surely not the place for it
([Glossary](Manual/Glossary "wikilink")/Appendix in the manual?).
