### Overview

This large magazine contains 50 rounds of 5.7x28mm ammunition. It
features a complicated triple-column arrangement, its rounds packed into
the magazine in three large stacks. The round itself shreds armour at
close range and produces horrific wounds. It typically generates low
recoil, but the round's gentle characteristics are overwhelmed by the
CRC-8's incredible rate of fire on full auto.

The magazine is meant to be loaded into a CRC-8 SMG.

### Recommended Doctrine

All soldiers equipped with SMGs should carry at least one reload
whenever they go out in the field. Two or more are strongly recommended
if the SMG is used as a primary weapon, since it can consume vast
amounts of ammunition. It is not advisable to send our troops into
combat without spare magazines.

### Addenda

None.
