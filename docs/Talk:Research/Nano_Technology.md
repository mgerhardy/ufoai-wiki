## Tried to fill out a bit.

There seems to be some confusion between Nano Technology and Advanced
Armor Fabrics, so I tried to stay within the parameters of the old
description so far. More later... --[Grumpy](User:Grumpy "wikilink")

Nano technology opens up a wide field of new production methods
especially in the design and production of armor and fabric. The
experience gained from research into advanced laser technologies and
control of plasma superheated plasma has provided us with a deeper
understanding of particle and molecular interactions. This understanding
enables us to design and chemically grow materials on a molecular level,
yielding special properties, such as flexible fabrics with a
heat-resistance normally found only in ceramics. Combined with
conducting and semiconducting high strength carbon nanotubes as well as
radiation absorbing complexes encapsulated in fullerenes (geodesic domes
at an atomic level) which can be used to fabricate armor that is more
robust and has higher resistance to known weapons technologies than any
known protection tested before. In particular, the recently analyzed
charged plasma beams are reported to dissipate over the surface of the
nano-material, consuming some of the fabric, but not passing through.
Not only that, but the nano-fabric is promising to also be lighter and
less restricting than similar conventional materials.
