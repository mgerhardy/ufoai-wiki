## Fruitful discussion

Edited excerpts from a fruitful discussion about plasma.

    <Winterslice> Makes sense. Plasma weapons fire plasma encased in plastic
              balloons that burst upon hitting.
    <Bandobras> (it will be in RC4, but in RC3 tachyons still fire balls)
    <Winterslice> Ionised gas
    <Bandobras> hmmm
    <Bandobras> gas does not sound good
    <Bandobras> but let's say the electric charge keeps it together
    <Bandobras> ... I guess not...
    <Winterslice> Plasma is ionised gas, simply. But plasma isn't -exactly- gas,
              it's its own state of matter.
    <Bandobras> the balloons are safer, but too complicated, seem like an excuse...
    <Winterslice> Not really, they're the most logical way to fire plasma.
    <Winterslice> Otherwise the plasma would blast out in a stream and disperse
              very quickly.
    <Bandobras> so, projectiles filled with plasma
    <Bandobras> you are right
    <Winterslice> Yes, projectiles filled with plasma.
    <Bandobras> so make it projectiles filled with plasma for the plasma balls
    <Bandobras> and stream of plasma for the Continuous Stream attack type
    <Bandobras> this stream is ions
    <Bandobras> fired one after another
    <Bandobras> they charge the air
    <Bandobras> so that the subsequent ion travel further
    <Bandobras> and finally most of the hits the target
    <Bandobras> I've heard id somewhere
    <Bandobras> the things is, these are very narrow beams, as in game
    <Winterslice> Hmmm, why not just turn it into a lightning gun?
    <Bandobras> we already have lasers
    <Winterslice> Use a laser to ionise the air, then send electricity directly
              from the power cell into the air.
    <Bandobras> have you played with plasma weapons?
    <Bandobras> this is just cool
    <Bandobras> I don't laser can ionise air...
    <Winterslice> They can.
    <Bandobras> perhas with fog...
    <Winterslice> It's one of the paths being researched for wireless tasers.
    <Bandobras> oh
    <Winterslice> In the real world, I mean.
    <Bandobras> hmm
    <Bandobras> but, what's wrong with short range plasma streams?
    <Winterslice> Sorry, you lost me.
    <Bandobras> (the plasma projectiles have longer range and bigger damage per
            shot)
    <Winterslice> You're looking at two different fire modes for plasma weapons,
              right?
    <Bandobras> yes
    <Bandobras> first is plasma projectiles
    <Winterslice> The main mode fires plasma balloons at a distant target.
    <Bandobras> yes
    <Winterslice> The second could be like I said, short-range plasma shotgun?
    <Bandobras> like I said :)
    <Bandobras> oh, you said that too
    <Bandobras> great

Laser ionization its uneffective way of high temperature plasma
production. It is better to use an electric arc. As cartridges double
charges can be used: one part - the accumulator or the capacitor in
which the stock of energy for creation of the plasma contains, the
second - an projectile part, from what or heavy, but fusible metal, for
example mercury or lead. In a long-range mode, the laser is used to
create the vacuum channel up to the target, in a shotgun mode, all
energy of the accumulator is spent for heating of a projectile, it flies
nearby because of braking by air, but the destructive effect is much
more. It's my vision. --[Eraser](User:Eraser "wikilink") 06:57, 4 August

Ha. Thanks for that. I think may use the "electric arc for creating
plasma" part. Why do you propose heavy projectiles? Wouldn't light ones
be better? This is not impact damage, after all... Oh, I get it, you
mean the projectiles would not be filled with plasma, but just whole
made of metal! Ha, this seems a bit too complex. Actually, in game (SVN
trunk, currently) the plasma-filled projectiles are the long range
attack mode and the stream of plasma is the shotgun mode. And what do
you think about the mechanism I suggested in plasma weapon descriptions?
