Curiosly, lines about effectiveness against robotic targets has popped
up here and in the SMG description. Is there gonna be a change of damage
type to facilitate this? [KingMob](User:KingMob "wikilink") 02:42, 20

The 'Normal' damage is just the damage type, which is a bit
unfortunately named. Robotic enemies have high resistances to lots of
attacks -- I don't know how exactly that'll pan out in-game, but it
should be similar to what I've described. If not, things can always
change. --[Winter](User:Winter "wikilink") 13:59, 20 September 2006

Well, that's what I was thinking, that may be best to convince the
coders to create a new type of damage, to differentiate between normal
damage that you'd receive from blunt trauma, bullets and knives, and
weapons capable of armor piercing? Just an idea.

It's probably obvious, but perhaps the addenda could note that crouching
is frequently very important to maximize accuracy with the sniper rifle.

Just wanted to point a little typo I found near the end of the overview
section, it reads LWRS where it should be LRWS, just letting you know.
