## Upgrading wiki version

Hi, the Atom feed of the Recent changes page is outputing html instead
of wikisynthax. I think it might have to do with the mediawiki version.
would you mind upgrading to a newer version? We at
[freegamedev](http://freegamedev.net/) are planning to build a
feed-aggregator for wiki edit feeds of free software games.

## Weapon tables scripts

Mattn, I have just read the message in my user talk page.

I can write the script, no problem, but I am having trouble with the
actual formulas. I had to resort to look into the code, and since I am
not familiar with it, it's been a lot of trouble. If you supply the
damage calculation formulas it will be easy. I even submitted bug report
\#2749737 regarding splash damage, please take a look at it, it's still
open and unassigned.

Hi

i've just seen that you've updated the weapon list. we are searching for
a way to generate a statistic for our weapons and ammo in relation to
the armour and the damage. do you think you could maybe also write such
a script? it would help us to balance the weapons more.

Thanks, writing (or better using) such a script would help us a lot.
I've forwarded this to [BTAxis](User:BTAxis "wikilink") - i hope he will
get back to you. --[Mattn](User:Mattn "wikilink") 17:27, 11 May 2009
