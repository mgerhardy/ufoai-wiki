Hullo, I'm Winter.

Writing is my trade; I'm an experienced freelancer and novelist, and I'm
the lead story developer for UFO:AI. Together with
[BTAxis](User:BTAxis "wikilink") I'm responsible for the entire
storyline and UFOpaedia.

My real name is Ryan A. Span, and you can find my personal/business
website here: <http://crossedswords.co.nr> I've written for a number of
companies including Flying Mice LLC, Eilfin Publishing, Chivalry
Consulting and Ikisoft.

Also, I go by Winterslice on IRC.
