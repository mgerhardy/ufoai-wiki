Mattn, my script is a bit crude, but it parses the ufos nicely using
python's xml.etree.ElementTree. Would you like me to mail it to you? You
can reply directly to my e-mail address. I do not have a website to put
it so that it can be linked to. :--[Dumper](User:Dumper "wikilink")

<http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=805244&group_id=157793&func=browse>
