Currently no weapons with that damage type.

Option: *Electric shock coupled with electromagnetical pulse, stunning
permanently mechanical actors and disabling for one turn alien weapons
(chance: damage in 100%) and biological actors (chance: damage in actor
HP), no conventional damage.*

With this option both EMP grenade and secondary Stun Rod fire could have
this damage type.
