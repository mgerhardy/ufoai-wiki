## Bug in Register user at issue tracker

Hi Matt i think you are the administrator here. I don't have any way to
contact because i can't register to issue tracker and report a bug. so
first of all, please create an email address or create for non register
user a way to contact you, because not all of them success like me. The
second thing, when i register to the issue tracker of ufoai:The Bug
Genie system: i get an email to activate my count. but i am think the
address is wrong because it say it not found on the system. i try to fix
the address without success, and i can't activate my account. because i
can't activate the account, i can't login to issue tracker. third thing.
I delete an old mail of activate the account, so now even you fix it, i
can activate my favorit user. please add an option that users can
activate and get again with new email there users name. please email me
for help. tal dot regev at gmail dot com.
