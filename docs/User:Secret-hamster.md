## The Secret Hamster

No-one is really sure who he is, one day he appearing from an unknown
burrow and started to write.

This curse has plagued many open source projects (well maybe just this
one) over a number of years (well since last week anyway), with it's
rambling, undirected, though good intentioned documentation

If you if no-one else is willing to write your manual, if you can afford
him and if you can find him <bang> <bang> <bang>

**Maybe you can hire The Secret Hamster**
