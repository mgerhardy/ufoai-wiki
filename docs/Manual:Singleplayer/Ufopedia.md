the knowledge PHALANX has gathered. It covers everything from reports
and statistics of aircrafts, weapons and base facilities as well as
preliminary reports on alien studies and research results.

The content is continuously updated with new knowledge as you research
technologies, discover new weapons, buildings, vehicles and aircrafts.

It will contain useful information on weapon usage tactics and
statistics, alien weaknesses and new technology advantages and research
proposals.
