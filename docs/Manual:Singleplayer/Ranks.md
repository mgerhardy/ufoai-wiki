TODO: *Write how ranks affect the various squad members in the
battlescape (boost/reduces morale?) and how the soldiers get them right
now.*

## outdated

While the actual implementation is still under heavy discussion a few
comments might help to understand how it works now. Different you ones
first thought the main criteria for promotions is not the missions /
kills ratio but the mind skill. You simply don't want an psychopathic,
thrill seeking terminator like guy as squadleader but someone who is
mentally stable ;) Also, up to now, there is only one member of you
squad that is going to be promoted while the rest is left with nothing.
Here a list of the different badges and their corresponding ranks.
