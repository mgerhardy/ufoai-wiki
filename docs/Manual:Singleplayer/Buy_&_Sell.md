## Buy & Sell Screen

![](market_buy_sell_screen.jpg "market_buy_sell_screen.jpg") Here you
can get new equipment from the global market or get rid of any item you
don't have further use for. Please be aware that the items not carried
by your soldiers at the end of a mission are sold automatically. Details
will be displayed on missions summary screen. If you want to use the
items captured you can simply buy them back here.

TODO: *Not true anymore*: As there is no differences between purchasing
and selling prices you won't "loose" money doing so. This is very likely
to be changed once the whole economy thing is set up right till then
global market can be exploited as a kind of unlimited equipment storage.

Please notice that the amount of any kind of items available may change
in the course of the game as your reputation in the world changes.

In order to help keeping an overview all items are sorted into four
categories again

- Primary
- Secondary
- Misc
- Armor
