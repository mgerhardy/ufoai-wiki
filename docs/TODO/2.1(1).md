## General

- Release Notes: **Remember that this time we will *not* create any
  'early' Release Candidates (RC). Please use 2.1-devXX for test builds
  and betas.** These builds should also be unannounced as such. The XX
  number should be incremented after each one. RCs will only be created
  when no new features are left for inclusion and a fairly stable
  code-base exists. This is also the point when a branch will be
  created. Thanks for the attention.

## Code

- Bugfixes
  - Truncated text

    - In scrolling nodes, the last word in a paragraph is getting
      trimmed instead of being moved to the next line.

    -

    - - This bug should be fixed now, please test.

  - ([Hoehrer](User:Hoehrer "wikilink")) second dropship does not return
    to the base - Manually sending it back works though. - Fixed by
    mattn. A lot of cleanup + sanity checks added.

  - ([Hoehrer](User:Hoehrer "wikilink")) We need some method of
    displaying pre-research descriptions before research is finished.

  - \[High priority\] Savegame bug reported massively on forum - new
    savegame system.

    - statistics (button on the geoscape) does not work after load
      (empty statistics menu)

      - I can't reproduce this on trunk to 2.1 branch

      - r7685

    - employees skills and abilities does not work after load (zeroed
      skills)

      - r7685

    - ranks are messed up after load (for example, soldiers with
      scientist rank - the order of ranks in array matters!)

      - r7694

    - storage is empty after load (no items "on the floor" in equip
      menu - related to similar multiplayer problem maybe?) IT RETURNS
      TO NORMAL AFTER /QUIT

      - r7685

    - no mails in mailclient after load

      - I can't reproduce this on trunk to 2.1 branch
        --[Mattn](User:Mattn "wikilink") 08:10, 18 April 2007 (CEST)
      - r7685

    - some of the tech-\>name are messed up after load (save right after
      building base, load, check out "Bolter Rifle" technology name in
      Research menu) IT RETURNS TO NORMAL AFTER /QUIT

    - After starting a new game, then loading a saved game (any saved
      game), clicking on the add/remove soldier button on the assign
      screen crashes the game.

    - problem with message subsystem - save and load reports different
      amount of bytes, sometimes loading fails on message subsystem

  - \[High priority\] Equipment bug with equipment not dissapearing from
    containers after its usage in multiplayer

    - I believe that r7582 fixes this - please test (including impact to
      singleplayer) and merge, if no error
      reports--[Zenerka](User:Zenerka "wikilink") 22:35, 15 April 2007
      (CEST)

  - \[High priority\] Find and verify the real source of the problem
    with starting a missions when more than one base and dropship with
    assigned team (forum and sf tracker to see more)

    - \<-- bt from newest testinstaller; can be related, can be related
      to some problems with employees saving (?)

    - r7693 should fix this - or at least now it is more sane; testing
      needed--[Zenerka](User:Zenerka "wikilink") 12:59, 18 April 2007
      (CEST)

  - Reintroduce soldier renaming again.

    - r7837 introduces that to trunk - please test and merge if
      everything is ok--[Zenerka](User:Zenerka "wikilink") 14:48, 23
      April 2007 (CEST)

  - cursor dissapears after leaving campaign and creating new
    singleplayer game

    - I cannot reproduce that in trunk
      (7882)--[Zenerka](User:Zenerka "wikilink") 20:10, 24 April 2007
      (CEST)

  - For some reason part of messages/mails are being added again (to
    both message system and mail system) after returning from a mission.
    In my case it was all laser-related research
    propositions--[Zenerka](User:Zenerka "wikilink") 00:01, 20 April

  - Problems with Buy/Sell menu related to scrolling

    - Autosell button is not being scrolled at all

    - Storage/Market values for given items are being scrolled, but
      Buy/Sell buttons (blue arrows) are not - that results in
      buying/selling undesired items after scroll (also see console
      output for using the arrows on scrolled items)

    - I've introduced CL_DebugAllItems_f()/debug_additems - use it to
      easily reproduce the problem--[Zenerka](User:Zenerka "wikilink")
