## Making PHALANX base pieces 2x2 ready

Some of the current base pieces do not fully support 2x2 units. It is
desirable for this to be the case, as the player will want to field UGVs

The following facilities have been checked. marks facilities that need
changes, marks facilities that are 2x2 ready. If a facility does not
appear in this list, it has not been checked.
