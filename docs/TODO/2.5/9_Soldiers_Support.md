9 soldiers support

- overcome the assert on assignment
- update equipment UI to support more than 8 soldiers
  - also the skirmish and multiplayer team ui
- create a HUD for 8++ soldiers
  - AltHUD and MiniHUD support up to 12 soldiers
  - DefaultHUD is still missing
- overcome the hardcoded limit in the skirmish menu
- add human spawnpoints to some of the dropship tiles
  - I checked +africa. Each dropship has 13 spawnpoints, so you can use
    it for your tests. If you need something more special, just tell.

  - I missed the baseattack. There could be a lot of soldiers in a base.
    Will the number of defenders be limited in some way?

### add human spawnpoints to some of the dropship tiles

- Each one should have at least 12 spawnpoints for soldiers than ?

  - If dropship is able to carry that number of soldiers. (i/e/ Firebird
    has only 8 teamslots. --[Kildor](User:Kildor "wikilink") 05:14, 9

    - I disagree. Should have as many as possible for each dropship, so
      that dropship capacity can be modded via scripts.

      - Yes, you are right. Also we need something like «randomspawn»
        for phalanx team too, don\`t we? And I think we need to move our
        discussion (and whole TODO-thread) to new page.

        - «randomspawn» property works for all spawnpoints the same way,
          in my experience [ShipIt](User:ShipIt "wikilink") 09:34, 15
