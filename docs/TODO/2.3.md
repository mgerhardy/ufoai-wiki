## Code

### Pathfinding and Tracing

- Fix problems with pathfinding so maps are playable

  - Resolve stepup problems

### Renderer

- fix terrain (material system) gaps between lightmaps/surfaces (fixed
  in r25155)

### Campaign

- [Off-base Installations](Proposals/Off-base_Installations "wikilink"),
  which can be placed on the geoscape to provide specialised functions

  - Radar Tower - Provides additional radar coverage on the geoscape,
    but less than the standard base.

  - SAM Site - These installations will attack UFOs in a small radius on
    the geoscape.

  - UFO Yard - Off-site storage for recovered UFO's.

- The [new campaign system](Gameplay_Proposals/Campaign "wikilink")

  - Introduce alien bases
    - Maps

    - Missions

### Equipment

- Incorporate alien needler to game. We have research article and model.

### Equipment menu and team handling

- Adjust machine gun magazine size to 2x2

- new soldier equip menu, see gallery for equip menu mockup and forum
  for some variants (see [Proposals/UI
  (2008)](Proposals/UI_(2008) "wikilink"))

### Production

- Aircraft and aircraft item production needs to be recoded as part of
  the main Production screen, replacing the current 'Other' category as
  'Aircraft'.

  - They have their own categories, left 'Other' intact

### Ufopedia & Research

- *I noticed that there are some research entries (such as plasma pistol
  and plasma pistol ammo) that use same name in ufopaedia and show same
  text, only different items. In IRC BTAxis stated that such items
  should be hidden from ufopaedia at all. mattn told me to ask you about
  that. Is there anything that could be used to hide articles?"*

  - Good point. This still has to be fixed ... i guess we'll just add a
    sort of redirect pointer (defined as something like
    "`redirect tech_id_of_weapon`") in the ufo files and the code so we
    can still have the actual (invisible) tech for the ammo in the
    background but actually open the weapon entry when appropriate. Also
    the duplicated gettext can then be removed of course.

  - Think I could to that this way: 1. add redirect code to ufo defines
    (in research.ufo), 2. update UP_TechGetsDisplayed to exclude such
    items that have redirect, 3. update code (such as buy menu) to go to
    the right ufopaedia for such items

  - Bug

### Reactionfire

- Reactionfire problems and enhancements.

  - server-side logic? (There is a [Gameplay
    Proposal](Proposals "wikilink") I think - pretty complex stuff
    though.)

### Other

- menu Won, option for storing recovered UFO: if all UFO hangars has no
  free space, popup offering replacing old UFO in hangars with new one,
  decide what to do with old one

  - Remove UFO recovery command from menu Won, and use popup on geoscape
    instead: UFO recovery should be usable also with missions made
    automatically

  - show some result for autogo missions

  - implement replacing ufo with the one from store position

- make notification messages and game pause configureable (decide for
  each message category whether message should be shown in log and
  whether game should pause)

  - Basic code is there, there are discussions about extending (for
    sound/popup). There are many placed where this should be used.

- make starfield rotate around earth in geoscape.

- Reduce craft and weapon speed to compensate for periodic detection

- Aliens are only shooting in reaction fire mode. They don't attack
  anymore.

### Multiplayer

- Players that created a server should be able to spread that news in
  the channel and all the other games that are not playing a game
  already should get a popup whether they want to connect.

### Saving

- Saving the savegame in a position independent format like xml See
  draft at [XMLSavegame](XMLSavegame "wikilink")
