This page is meant to collect everything about the UFO Carrier mission.

## What we have

- There is the description [how the mission fits into the
  storyline](Storyline_Missions#UFO_Carrier_mission "wikilink").
- There is a proposal [how the mission could look
  like](Talk:Research/Orbital_UFO_Activity "wikilink").
- We already have a model of the UFO Carrier.
- We have a proposal about an alternative model for UFO.
- We have a [research text](UFO/Carrier "wikilink") for the UFO Carrier.

## TODO

- We need to make a decision whether we use the existing model or the
  alternative design.
  - I think this decision will be made by whoever makes the map. If they
    can create an approved alternative design (model) and the
    accompanying map, that's fine. If they create a map with the
    existing model, that's fine. --[H-hour](User:H-hour "wikilink")

- It is proposed to split the mission into at least two parts. Do we
  want to go this way?
  - We need a working trigger_nextmap or similar.
  - trigger_nextmap exists but is not thoroughly tested, I think.
    --[H-hour](User:H-hour "wikilink") 20:32, 1 May 2012 (CEST)
    - Sometimes it works, sometimes it does not. Bug needs to be fixed.

- The first part of the battlescape mission - wich terrain?
  - The carrier looks pretty big. The dropship could land on the downed
    UFO. No need to show any terrain then.
    [ShipIt](User:ShipIt "wikilink")
  - We can use dummy textures mechanism, like it done for +ufocrash,
    .baseattack and +hills. --[Kildor](User:Kildor "wikilink") 15:22, 30

    - No plants, no trees, too? [ShipIt](User:ShipIt "wikilink") 07:25,
      2 May 2012 (SAST)
      - Yes. we have. I was talking about a **working** one.

      - The mission is proposed to show up in "a fixed location". I
        think this means it will take place at the same location each
        time. Just somebody needs to point his finger at this place on
        the worldmap. [ShipIt](User:ShipIt "wikilink") 09:06, 1 May 2012

        - No, I think it is not supposed to land in the same location
          each time, and the dummy textures mechanism is expected to be
          used. --[H-hour](User:H-hour "wikilink") 20:32, 1 May 2012

          - The only official description I found so far is in the
            [Storyline Missions](Storyline_Missions "wikilink"). This
            one says " ... Then the mission shows up on the geoscape in
            a fixed location.". Maybe itÂ´s just about my bad english.
            [ShipIt](User:ShipIt "wikilink") 07:25, 2 May 2012 (SAST)
            - I guess that's fine. Carrier location probably wouldn't be
              enough to effect player's choice of base location anyway.
