## TODO

- Integrate basic checking for maps - like:
  - info_2x2_start must have a teamnum
  - rma theme dropships must have at least 8 player spawnpoints
  - if mapdef (maps.ufo) has multiplayer set, there must be multiplayer
    starting points, too
  - a multiplayer starting point must have a teamnum set
- Integrate unit tests into the build chain
  - Current status
  - Add revision/branch to the CUnit xml output
  - Archive CUnit output per revision/branch
  - Convert XML to HTML, some web browser can't do it themself
  - Better Buildbot integration
    - Catch error, mail people?, ping people on IRC?
    - Web links between CUnit output page and buildbot pages
- Set up and configure buildchains for mac and solaris (cross compile)
- Create a nightly build that creates a dmg for mac (maybe even debian
  packages)
