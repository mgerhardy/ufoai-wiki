## General

- Finally release version 2.0 so people stop complaining about why the
  'stable' version is still a release candidate. Or are there any major
  bugs or missing features left?

## Artwork

- Verify and improve [particles](UFO-Scripts/ptl_*.ufo "wikilink") for
  all not postponed weapons.
  - What's the status of this task? And is this the only thing left for
    2.0 stable? --[Hoehrer](User:Hoehrer "wikilink") 12:21, 11 January

  - I don't think anyone's actually working on particles. We should just
    go ahead and release the thing. --[Winter](User:Winter "wikilink")
