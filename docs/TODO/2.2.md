## General

- [Add svn properties to stuff in our
  repository](TODO/2.2/SVN_Properties "wikilink")

- Check if the suggestions and complains in the comment "Nice looking
  game but opaque interface" by Irrevenant
  ([1](http://happypenguin.org/show?UFO%3A%20Alien%20Invasion)) can be
  (or are already) implemented. He kind of hit some very obvious spots
  here.

  - Tooltips for inventory-items (and which weapon they can be loaded in
    for ammo)

    - Implement item tooltips

    - Some more tweaks are needed to show more information like
      proposed.

    - better formatting? (*newlines*, maybe even color?)

  - Add hints so the player knows what building is needed to do
    different things .. even if we have to resort to "Tips of the
    Day"-esque stuff.

    - [Tip of the Day](Tip_of_the_Day "wikilink") is implemented since
      r9467 - fill tips into the file.

  - interface annoyance: "*When an enemy unit is sighted, a red line
    appears between the sighter and sightee. That is very handy, but
    when the enemy is a couple of levels up or down, the red line
    vanishes before you can change levels to see where it where it goes.
    (If the camera followed the length of the line and back that would
    be very helpful in this case - a hotkey to jump to autocentre the
    sightee would be great).*"

    - At least we now have a button to jump to the sighted enemy(ies)
      ... no quite what this request is about, but it's a start. ... I
      would propose we add something that can draw the line from our
      soldier to the target (if the selected one can directly see the
      target) afterwards and smoothly shifts from the soldiers position
      to the target and back ... but this might be better for a later
      release. --[Hoehrer](User:Hoehrer "wikilink") 16:04, 9 February
      2007 (CET)
    - Perhaps this could be implemented as a hotkey that re-draws the
      overlay lines for the currently selected soldier to the actors
      (Aliens or Civilians) who are visible by the current actor. This
      would also be useful for situations where the other actor has been
      spotted, but is hard to see due to the shadows.
      --[Foxxtrot](User:Foxxtrot "wikilink") 18:14, 25 June 2007 (CEST)
    - There is now a console command called **drawspottedlines** - it is
      not yet assigned to any key or interface button but we are getting
      there :) --[Hoehrer](User:Hoehrer "wikilink") 20:37, 22 July 2007
      (CEST)
    - The `drawspottedlines` command has been bound to the key (it
      displays a line to each visible enemy from the selected soldier).
      Not perfect, but certainly better than nothing. I think a "cycle
      trough visible enemies of this soldier" function would be nice as
      well - The main issue has been adressed now though so this would
      be a new feature. :) --[Hoehrer](User:Hoehrer "wikilink") 15:45, 6
      August 2007 (CEST)

- Status of the manual?

  - The [Manual](Manual "wikilink") is being worked on, but we have to
    keep in mind that a lot of things may change while it is written.
    --[Hoehrer](User:Hoehrer "wikilink") 16:04, 9 February 2007 (CET)

- Add text to the [Tip of the Day](Tip_of_the_Day "wikilink") file

- Headgear

  - Place the headgear slot in the inventory and equip menus

  - We need a button on both huds that activates the headgear in the
    headgear slot (if there is one)

  - Implement the headgear 'fire' button

  - Actors that got visible due to headgear should be drawn in a red
    color

  -  2.2 trunk 9947 - IR goggles disappear after one mission

## Code

- [XVI](TODO/XVI "wikilink") -- Requirements for XVI system in 2.2 and
  beyond.
- [TODO/2.2/Research System](TODO/2.2/Research_System "wikilink") --
  Needs development on several points.
- [UFO Recovery](TODO/2.2/UFO_Recovery "wikilink") -- Proposal for
  handling UFO recovery and disassembly.
- [Inventory Bugs](TODO/2.2/Inventory_Bugs "wikilink")

- [Armour](TODO/2.2/Armour "wikilink")

### New Network Code

- Bug *2.2 trunk 9933 Disconnect and server shutdown not promoted*

  - Player is still connected after disconnect (at least the server
    thinks that)
  - mapchange doesn't call the spawn/new/precache function for the
    connected clients (only the server works)

- Bug *2.2 trunk 9916 - StateChange message ignored... LE not found*

- Bug *multiplayer hang*

- Bug *2.2 trunk 9768 - Can't move, LE doesn't exist*

- Bug *\[MAC\] Broken pipe opening the multiplayermenu - new netcode*

- Bug *More than the allowed number of actors after reconnect*

[Winsock Programmer's
FAQ](http://tangentsoft.net/wskfaq/articles/bsd-compatibility.html)

### Server side particles

Server side particles means, that the server is sending
EV_PARTICLE_SPAWN events to the client

- Fix the LE think function LET_ProjectileAutoHide

  - it's not the LET_ProjectileAutoHide function, but the particle
    subsystem. A particle can be set to invisible, but the init function
    already has spawned their children particles and the parent itself
    is destroyed in the next run or even at the end of the init
    function.

- Use this method for smoke grenades - so that a player that didn't see
  the smoke while throwing the grenade is able to see it in the next
  round when he walk there

### Reactionfire

- Reactionfire problems and enhancements.

  - Reactionfire fd set for given soldier in last mission is remembered
    partially for next mission, that is fd chosen before is selected on
    the firemodelist, but when shooting with reactionfire, default is
    used; enabling RF with other fd and then enabling chosen again works

    - I think this is already fixed. The settings should not be
      remembered anymore, needs to be confirmed though.
      --[Hoehrer](User:Hoehrer "wikilink")

  - Clicking on RF select on fd list should NOT change soldier state to
    shoot

    - Cause: the checkbox images are overlayed over the fire buttons and
      the game does always execute *all* stuff in the area the mouse is
      in .. no matter of the "z-depth". A quick workaround (but no
      solution) is to place the checkboxes a bit to the left (no
      overlapping).--[Hoehrer](User:Hoehrer "wikilink") 14:44, 1 April
      2007 (CEST)
    - A fix to SVN-trunk and 2.1 branch has been committed. I found no
      problems with this solution, so i'll call this fixed.
      --[Hoehrer](User:Hoehrer "wikilink") 15:14, 15 April 2007 (CEST)

  - Make sure that server knows about state of reactionfire for soldier
    (single RF/multiple RF) and replace \#define TU_REACTION 7 with
    macro which will give 7 for single or 14 for multiple. The reason is
    to make multiple RF less powerful by taking more time from
    player--[Zenerka](User:Zenerka "wikilink") 12:56, 2 April 2007
    (CEST)

    - The patch has been committed to trunk and 2.1.1. It's better than
      the current mutli-rf for sure. Further enhancement/rework of the
      RF system needs to be discussed separately. (see gameplay
      [Proposals](Proposals "wikilink"))
      --[Hoehrer](User:Hoehrer "wikilink") 17:18, 13 April 2007 (CEST)

  - Make sure the RF button on HUD is blocked (as in: greyed out) in
    cl_actor.c/CL_RefreshWeaponButtons() with new TU_REACTION macro

### Facility limits

- Base facilities limits usage - currently there is a 'capacity' member
  of 'building_t' struct in the code; the purpose of this is to limit
  various things for various facilities

  - The general parser and capacity updates on building/destroying
    buildings is done in r7223--[Zenerka](User:Zenerka "wikilink")
    22:50, 2 April 2007 (CEST)

  - Alien Containment capacity limits the amount of alive aliens able to
    being stored - finished in r7228--[Zenerka](User:Zenerka "wikilink")
    00:07, 3 April 2007 (CEST)

  - Storage capacity limits the amount of items - use this in buy/sell
    menu, and collecting items code

    - I need some help here. How to limits items? By amount only? That
      would be kinda strange - small ammo clip would take as much
      storage space as armour.--[Zenerka](User:Zenerka "wikilink")
      22:50, 2 April 2007 (CEST)
      - Each item should have a Storage stat governing how much space it
        takes up in base storage. I'll create a list.
        --[Winter](User:Winter "wikilink") 12:55, 11 April 2007 (CEST)
      - List is here: [TODO/2.2//Storage
        Size](TODO/2.2/Storage_Size "wikilink")
        --[Winter](User:Winter "wikilink") 14:37, 11 April 2007 (CEST)
      - Updating capacities on aircraft with team leaving/returning has
        to be postponed for future work, when we will rewrite
        inventory/equip code and menu. Any work at this right now would
        be just waste of time.--[Zenerka](User:Zenerka "wikilink")
        22:40, 6 May 2007 (CEST)

  - Hangars capacities - limits the amount of aircraft - use this in
    buy/sell aircraft menu -
    r7410/7411--[Zenerka](User:Zenerka "wikilink") 23:54, 10 April 2007
    (CEST) (note that UFO hangars limits still needs to be coded)

  - rewrite existing code about workshop, quarters, laboratory and
    hospital limits to use new
    capacities--[Zenerka](User:Zenerka "wikilink") 22:50, 2 April 2007
    (CEST)

    - laboratory limits finished in
      r7262--[Zenerka](User:Zenerka "wikilink") 13:36, 4 April 2007
      (CEST)

    - workshop limits; workshop limits and production times updating
      after building more workshops and hiring more workers -
      r7399--[Zenerka](User:Zenerka "wikilink") 23:54, 10 April 2007
      (CEST)

    - hospital limits - r8105--[Zenerka](User:Zenerka "wikilink") 23:54,
      1 May 2007 (CEST)

    - living quarters limits - finished in
      r7580--[Zenerka](User:Zenerka "wikilink") 21:06, 15 April 2007
      (CEST)

  - integrate hospital limits into new Kracken's system about separate
    list of wounded soldiers being sent to the mission

- limits for Antimatter Storage facility -
  r9539--[Zenerka](User:Zenerka "wikilink") 20:14, 7 July 2007 (CEST)

### Transfer code

- remove usage of dropship in transfer missions - according to Winter
  transfer should be done "as is", without any craftship usage

- implement personel transfering -
  r9966--[Zenerka](User:Zenerka "wikilink") 13:36, 22 July 2007 (CEST)

- implement aircraft transfering

- integrate the facility limits (base-\>capacities) into transfer code
  for every type of transfer

- add missing scrolls to the Transfer menu node

- menu layout update

  - nodes layout updated in revision 10734; the layout pictures
    left--[Zenerka](User:Zenerka "wikilink") 02:55, 12 August 2007
    (CEST)

- fix reported bugs:

  - Bug *Transfer Equipment Between Bases Bug*
  - Bug *Can't transfer laser weapons*
  - Bug *Transferring gas grenades makes them disappear*

- remove obsolete code and fix transfer saving

- for antimatter transfering use Antimatter Storage capacities (testing,
  removing, adding)

- bug: something is wrong with transfer saving and loading - not all
  needed info is restored - fixed in
  r10864--[Zenerka](User:Zenerka "wikilink") 13:14, 16 August 2007
  (CEST)

### Equipment

- **Equipment & Weapons**
  - Please leave this in the todo list for reference [Extend weapon and
    ammo
    combinations](TODO/2.1/Extend_weapon_and_ammo_combinations "wikilink")

  - \[Priority medium\] "One-shot weapons"

    - New/changed code for the [Plasma
      Blade](Equipment/Secondary_Weapons/Plasma_Blade "wikilink") and
      the [Stun Rod](Equipment/Secondary_Weapons/Stun_Rod "wikilink").
      They are one-shot weapons (the stun rod has several shots but no
      ammo) (e.g. You melee attack once and then it's practically
      worthless). --[Hoehrer](User:Hoehrer "wikilink")

    - Currently the behaviour is a workaround since the items are not
      useless/destroyed afterwards, they are reusable after the mission
      (more exactly: after the 'load' part I introduced is called again)
      ... which isn't really a problem for the stunrod I think, but
      might be for the plasmablade (when it is used by our soldiers, not
      the aliens that is). If this is no issue i consider the feature
      100% implemented, if it is we need to add some code to check for
      the "destruction" of such items after use.
      --[Hoehrer](User:Hoehrer "wikilink") 21:31, 15 February 2007 (CET)

      - or, as a workaround maybe, add additional boolean parameter to
        item definition (collectable false) and don't collect those in
        CL_CollectItems()--[Zenerka](User:Zenerka "wikilink") 10:22, 21
        February 2007 (CET)
      - I've done that in trunk (used only with plasma blade right now).
        Couldn't test it yet though.
        --[Hoehrer](User:Hoehrer "wikilink") 12:13, 21 February 2007
        (CET)
      - After reconsidering this, I think this is bad idea, because it
        won't allow you to collect plasma blade not used before (blades
        which were thrown to the ground when killing/stunning an alien)
        thus there won't be chance to research it; maybe the way to
        implement this should be just to remove depletable items (local
        entities) after using it? maybe in some client shooting
        functions?--[Zenerka](User:Zenerka "wikilink") 16:49, 22
        February 2007 (CET)

    - plasma blade does not disappear from the hand after being used.

    - remove the oneshot && deplete code from INV_CollectingItems(), it
      is not needed anymore - oneshot/deplete weapons should be
      automaticaly destroyed after being used - see proposed patch
      <http://pastebin.ca/658143>

    - plasmablade does not launch impact particle nor sound when thrown
      misses the target

      - proposed patch: <http://pastebin.ca/658143> it contains one
        additional bug, though--[Zenerka](User:Zenerka "wikilink")
        12:45, 15 August 2007 (CEST)

  - IR Goggles: Only make the units visible that stand in the direction
    the actor looks (done via G_FrustomVis check)

### Multiplayer

- Multiplayer improvements:

  - in cooperative mode, inform an user on the HUD when he already
    clicked EndOfTurn

    - the basics are done - a new network event EV_ENDROUNDANNOUNCE

  - in cooperative mode, inform an user on the HUD when teammate spotted
    new alien

  - show chat messages longer time - make a list of chat messages up of
    the screen, allow to be 6 lines there and let those lines slowly
    dissapear; when one at the top will dissapear, let rest of them move
    one line up; when someone make new chat message, his new line should
    go to the bottom.

    - how about having a shortcut key which will make all the chat
      visible while it is pressed (and then go when released), kind of
      the like the current tooltip type effect? seems a good choice to
      me - it's near the other chat
      keys.--[Blondandy](User:Blondandy "wikilink") 12:15, 8 June 2007
      (CEST)

  - when not in Coop mode, but more than two players (for example
    1vs1vs1) show info which player is currently moving

  - implement checksum mechanism for scriptfiles (to prevent cheating)

### UFO Recovery and production disassembling

- UFO hangars capacities, UFO crafts weight

  - Update capacity.cur for UFO hangars after adding recovered UFO

- Menu Won with options for UFO recoveries in case of UFO secured during
  the mission

  - (button) Store UFO in UFO hangars with base selection popup

  - (button) Sell UFO to desired nation with nation selection popup

    - And how should given nation happiness raise in case of selling the
      UFO?--[Zenerka](User:Zenerka "wikilink") 10:48, 9 May 2007 (CEST)

  - (button) Destroy UFO

  - Menu Won layout needs updating because of new buttons

- Daily campaign run for recovery progress

- clean a mess with UFO crafts research topics, code to enable UFO craft
  research topic after recovering an UFO and bringing it to base

- disassembling UFO

  - Code to handle amount of special items in case of disassembling UFO

  - Code to disassembling run (similar to production run, disassembling
    should be in production queue as well)

- Store UFO in given hangar

- Production menu reorganization

  - Two new buttons: for dummy items and for disassembling items

  - Code to handle items which can be disassembled

- recovering special items from crashsites

### Base operations

- Forbid to launch aircrafts if no Command Centre in operational status
  in base. - r9089--[Zenerka](User:Zenerka "wikilink") 18:27, 13 June
  2007 (CEST)

- Many buildings should not be operational without power supply. -
  r9041--[Zenerka](User:Zenerka "wikilink") 13:22, 12 June 2007 (CEST)

- Implement correct credits calculation at campaign start for both
  options 'starts with/without buildings'; see
  <http://voovoos.killfile.pl/roznosci/ufo/prices.txt>

- Let the missile battery interact in the geoscape action, too - the
  missile rack should be able to shoot down UFOs, too.


If an UFO was able to shoot several times to a base and redruce the
"health" of the base to a given level, the missile rack is destroyed and
the UFO is able to set the base under attack.

### Misc

- add the R_CHECK_ERROR macro to most of the gl calls

- when a player is connected with the in-game irc client, highlight priv
  messages everywhere in the game

- footsteps and terrain specific particles for walking (taken by
  [Zenerka](User:Zenerka "wikilink") and
  [Mattn](User:Mattn "wikilink") - also see [Revision
  10098](http://ufoai.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/ufoai?view=rev&revision=10098))

  - The basic code to issue sound and particle is done (r10098)

    - We can not only distinguish between terrain type (texture type),
      but also between actor type - so the UGV could play different
      sound on the wood surface than Ortnok would do - the
      CL_PlaySoundFileAndParticleForSurface() needs an extension in that
      case

  - scriptfile with sound2texture and particle2texture mapping -
    currently i am surfing through all our maps to figure out every type
    of surface texture, and slowly adding them into terrain.ufo; this
    will take some time--[Zenerka](User:Zenerka "wikilink") 12:48, 25
    July 2007 (CEST)

  - mapping parser

  - Send footstep infos to other connected players by the server, too

    - Somehow mark the actor that notes the sound - e.g. change the
      actor cursor - or icon over head

    - If footstep loud enough, Reaction fire activated, let the listener
      turn around in the direction of the sound

  - footstep sounds for every type of surface texture (and actor)

  - particles for some types of surface texture (sand -\> dust particle,
    but obviously no particle for metal surface)

- \[High priority\] Fix random map assembly (and crashes while
  assembly)
  Random map assembling is absolutely vital for crash site assemblies.
  Broken things are aside others: Pathfinding in various map-segments
  and segfaults when loading. For more information and bug-reports on
  map assembly see the following places:

  - Bug *crash site map assembly (e.g. maps/ufocrashd.ump)*

  - Bug *Numerous Map-Bugs:No-go-Areas and little shadow defects*

    - might be fixed by Gerd's patch - see
      [Rev.10874](http://ufoai.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/ufoai?view=rev&revision=10874)

  - Bug *Assembling random map - wrong theme-name*

  - Bug *Crash assembling map "+villaged big"*

    - map compiler (see also )

- Add aircraft interceptions and crash site assemblies (taken by
  [Kracken](User:Kracken "wikilink") and [Mattn](User:Mattn "wikilink"))

- for the purpose of crashsite missions divide the geoscape to the more
  types of terrain; such terrain should be: jungle, desert, arctic,
  mountains, urban (for heavy urbanized regions and big cities),
  village, steppe/grassland

- provide code basis for mission placement: a function is needed which
  is supplied with terrain restrictions and returns a location on
  Geoscape

- preload all character models and weapon models for faster menu
  switching

  - armored models are still missing in precaching stage

  - loading bar

-  Fix the bug with Rocket Launcher firing - the target plays death
  animation before the rocket reaches it

  - See also
    [TODO/General#Reported_Bugs](TODO/General#Reported_Bugs "wikilink")
    -\> bug 1542759

- Improve the message system into something like a email-client.

  - Add menu/screen for logged messages which can can be searched (in
    categories?) - mattn implemented basic email menu

  - [Winter](User:Winter "wikilink") wrote quite a bit of
    nicely-formatted messages (email-style) for all kind of messages
    related to bases/aircraft/constructions/etc. - put them in
    events.ufo

  - parser for e-mail messages (to not hardcode headers and other stuff,
    but format it in scriptfile - events.ufo)

- Add an event system. --[Hoehrer](User:Hoehrer "wikilink")

  - Support for events is already (basically) implemented in the
    research system.

  - The only thing missing is the event system itself. This being event
    definitions (id/message+type/year+day are defined), parsing (See for
    a basic system) and storing in the global data somewhere (like the
    rest of the "news" that is collected already.) (see cl_events.c and
    rev. r13056)

  - Display these events/news in an easy to search screen (same problem
    as for current "e-mail" style stuff)

  rotate to face the cursor)

- extend the parser of alien team definitions to allow numbers of
  particular race (and when no number given - random amount, as it is
  now) - this is needed to for example not allowing team with 1 Taman

### Menu

- Implement scrollbars for text nodes

- Implement new node types:

  - Checkbox (only 0 and 1 cvar values)

  - Selectbox (different options for one cvar)

  - The exported tag file leads to crashes
    ([Hoehrer](User:Hoehrer "wikilink"))

  - The model has its death animation too high (taken by

      and menu-anims. --[Hoehrer](User:Hoehrer "wikilink") 11:19, 5 July
