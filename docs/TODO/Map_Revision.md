## Introduction

Over the years we have accumulated a large number of maps, which helps
prevent missions from being too repetitive. However, these maps vary
significantly in the quality of tactical combat they offer. **The Great
Map Revision Project of 2.6** (bold is mandatory) will seek to organize
our existing maps, combine them into larger themes where beneficial, and
improve the [tactical density](Mapping/Map_Analyses/Mansion "wikilink")
of the maps.

While this project is being organised, most of the discussion will take
place in the Talk page.
