## Article naming

the original article is
[Equipment/Secondary_Weapons/Submachine_Gun](Equipment/Secondary_Weapons/Submachine_Gun "wikilink") -
so why is this translated with "Schweres"? It's a sub machine gun

this is also my opinion. Perhaps this also could be translated with
[Maschinenpistole](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maschinenpistole) (and
[Maschinengewehr](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maschinengewehr) for the
heavy one - perhaps even "Maschinenpistole" vs. "Schweres
Maschinengewehr" to make it more obviously)
