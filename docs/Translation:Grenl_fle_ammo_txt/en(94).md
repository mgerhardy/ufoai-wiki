### Overview

This is a box of 6 25mm flechette grenades. They are fired
electronically by a spark igniter inside the launcher's barrel. While
still classified as grenades due to their calibre and delivery system,
they have more in common with shotgun shells. Each grenade contains 24
solid steel needles packed into a sabot shell that breaks away
immediately after leaving the muzzle. This creates a buckshot-like
effect that can shred unarmoured or lightly-armoured enemies, but their
lower muzzle velocity compared to shotgun shells makes them
significantly less effective against heavy armour.

These grenades are meant to be loaded into an HPGL Grenade Launcher.

### Recommended Doctrine

All soldiers equipped with grenade launchers should carry at least one
reload whenever they go out in the field. It is not advisable to send
our troops into combat without spare grenades.

### Addenda

None.
