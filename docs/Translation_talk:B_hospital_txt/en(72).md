Wouldn't it be simpler and cheaper to send wounded soldiers to any civil
hospital for some time, say 4 weeks ?

You mean, simpler in realism terms, or game-play fun? I think the
hospital and other medic-based effects can be fun. About realism --- how
about civil hospitals having no access to tachyon control theory, plasma
weapons theory, etc. and so being less effective?

I'd propose that morale recovery is started only after healing is
complete. But we should see how it plays out...

I thing, medical based facilities in base are good - if needed, you have
always wounded soldiers in reach (e.q. in case of invazion to base).
