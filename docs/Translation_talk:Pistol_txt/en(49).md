Excellent choice with the Tokarev pistol round for the pistol in this
game. It's honestly a better choice than the two obvious alternatives:
The [5.7mm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.7x28_mm) round that the P90
uses, or the [4.6mm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4.6x30mm) round the
mp7 uses. [.357 Sig](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/357_Sig) round would
have been another fine choice, but the Tokarev pistol round is a great
round with a good military history. [KingMob](User:KingMob "wikilink")

Thank you. I did consider the 5.7mm P90 round (not the others, though),
but it made more sense to me to use a Russian cartridge for a distinctly
Russian weapon. The Tokarev is also a known penetrator with a long
service history and is even today performing extremely well in pistols
like the CZ-52. I like high-tech weaponry as much as the next guy, but
sometimes there's something to be said for the traditional approach. --
