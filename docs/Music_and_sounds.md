## General

We use Ogg Vorbis for music and WAV or Ogg Vorbis (since revision 9682)
for soundeffects. Sounds should have a minimum of 44 kHz. Ambience
sounds preferably in stereo.

## How to contribute

Please also have a look at the [TODO-list](TODO "wikilink") to see which
sounds are still missing.

## Programs

- [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/)


Very good program, open-source and available from sourceforge.

- [Reaper](http://www.reaper.fm)


Excellent multitrack DAW software program that is uncrippled, unexpiring
shareware that only nags you for a few sec. if you don't register it. It
comes with tons of plugins to enchance recording.

- [Voxengo](http://www.voxengo.com/)


Has some decent free plugins for enhancing sound in VST plugin format
(which will go right into Reaper, or Audacity with the VST enabler)

## Sound system

You can control the sound volume in several ways. Attenuation values can
be defined in the *firedef* for a weapon e.g., see
[UFO-Scripts/weapon_\*.ufo](UFO-Scripts/weapon_*.ufo "wikilink") for
more information. You can add a volume property to your
[misc_sound](Mapping/Entities/misc_sound "wikilink")
[entity](Mapping/Entities "wikilink") in your [map](Mapping "wikilink")
and you can modify the cvar.
