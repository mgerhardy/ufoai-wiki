## General

You need a 3D graphics card and a suitable driver which is installed on
your system to run UFO:AI. There is no software renderer available.

You can use commandline parameters to start the game.

- **+map \<day\|night\> \[mapname\]** will automatically start the given
  map
- **+set \[cvar\] \[value\]** will automatically set the
  [cvar](cvars "wikilink") from start

Examples:

- **+map day farm** starts the map *farm* in the day mode
- **+set r_mode 6** sets the given [cvar](cvars "wikilink") to value *6*

Every available [command](commands "wikilink") can be executed and every
available [cvar](cvars "wikilink") be set in this way from the
commandline.
