### Overview

This magazine contains 30 rounds of 4.7x33mm caseless ammunition,
armour-piercing mod. It is of a classic curved box design with the
rounds stacked in a dual-column arrangement. The rounds themselves are
tungsten-cored steel penetrators, encased in their own propellant rather
than heavy brass casings. They perform well against a variety of enemies
at short and medium ranges.

The magazine is meant to be loaded into an AR-80 Assault Rifle.

### Recommended Doctrine

All soldiers equipped with assault rifles should carry at least one
reload whenever they go out in the field. It is not advisable to send
our troops into combat without spare magazines.

### Addenda

None.
