It is the year 2084. Earth, never the most stable of places, enjoys a
time of relative peace. The violent beginnings of the 21st century are
far away now; distant memories, but not so distant that they've been
forgotten. To most of Earth's people, the Second Cold War is a dark
shadow from the past, much like the World Wars were to the children of
the late 20th.
