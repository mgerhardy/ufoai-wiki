We currently have a very open policy for wiki-access, but if spamming
gets out of hands we will change write-access only to registered
wiki-users.

## Policy

### Documentation & Translation

**Story Writers**


Most pages that have been written by our story developers (mainly
[Winter](User:Winter "wikilink")) will have their pages locked once
finished.

<!-- -->


The main reason is that our translators need informations what has
changed so they can update their text as well. Doing this without any
system will end up in caos, so please bear with us here.

**Translators**


Translators are adviced to do the same to their finished translatied
wiki-pages and tell fixes that they come along to the *english* talk
pages (which are the source for translations, see above).

**General**


If you find errors in one of these texts **please use the
talk/discussion page for that page** to point it out.

See also [List of msgid](List_of_msgid "wikilink") and
[Translating](Translating "wikilink").

### Wiki Access

If you are a story-writer, translator or coder and can't lock a page,
please contact [me](User:Hoehrer "wikilink") or
[mattn](User:Mattn "wikilink") so we can add you to the right
wiki-group.
