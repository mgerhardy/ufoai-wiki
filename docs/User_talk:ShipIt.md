## Impressions / Notes from playing the campaign in 2.5-dev

After a lot of the campaign balancing changes, the wounds system and the
weight system are roughly in place I started a new campaign. Want to
keep track of the findings here. Playing on standart difficulty.

- Only two missions within the first six weeks. The 8th mission already
  a Harvester, Plasma Rifles and Plasma Blasters. The 9th again
  Harvester, Shevaar with Plasma Blasters. This gives the feel that the
  difficulty level is increasing faster than intended.
- Less UFOs mean less income from selling UFOs and loot. Robotic aliens
  give no loot at all. So some missions end up in a net loss for the
  player. Also, not beeing able to sell UFOs makes it harder to keep
  nation happyness in balance. This means the income is mostly from the
  nations funding at this stage.
- The Wounds System and the Weight System make up for even more micro
  management (switching soldiers more often after missions to sort the
  wounded ones out, check the strength improvement of soldiers to
  possibly increase the equipment load).
- When Fighter UFOs and later Harvesters appear there is a risk of
  inexperienced players loosing interceptors and being forced to reload
  the game because of insufficient funds.
- 16th mission - 2084/26/06 armoured Tamans appear, soldiers already
  wear Plasma Rifles and Pistols, but short on ammo because of limited
  production capacity

## City Map Project

I'm sure you've probably already thought of this, but I wanted to
mention that a UFO will almost never crash in an urban population area.
This means that a large city map will almost exclusively occur with
landed Terror missions (maybe XVI/Harvest, but I don't think they pick a
city target). Avoiding the crashed UFOs will save you a LOT of work. You
could at least postpone them to the end. Also, you might consider
whether it's worth having even the landed UFOs. Making room for a
Bomber, Gunboat or Corrupter all take up more than a 4x4 RMA grid, which
can make difficulties for layout planning. It also means that, in the
late game, a player will spend a lot of his time fighting inside the
UFOs, which all have the same layout. Making Terror missions not have
the UFO seems plausible (the UFO has landed off-map, since cities don't
have clear landing spaces). It also would allow the player to enjoy the
diversity of the map rather than spending his time clearing yet another
large UFO. Again, both of these points are just things to consider. You
probably already have, but I thought I'd mention them as they may make
things a bit easier. --[H-hour](User:H-hour "wikilink") 16:36, 10

- Thanks for your feedback. My thoughts were indeed like yours, although
  I was not sure about the UFOs for the certain mission types. Because
  we do not have a lot of maps for those UFOs yet, I wanted to start
  with a map for the Corrupter and Bomber UFO, with the intention to
  have one assembly were the UFO is shown and another, smaller one,
  without UFO. After this, we´ll see. --[ShipIt](User:ShipIt "wikilink")

I saw a mall todo point - please keep in mind that
[H-hour](User:H-hour "wikilink") has already started another building
that should have become a mall or something like that - i'm almost sure
it's in
