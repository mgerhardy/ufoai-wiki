I came by this project back when it was still being worked on by the old
team (led by SparX). Back then I didn't do much except post on the
forums, but as the project died I ended up idling around in the then
unofficial IRC channel on Quakenet, along with a handful of others. This
changed when [mattn](User:mattn "wikilink") showed up and brought the
project back to life. Now, I'm a developer of the [Official
storyline](Storyline/Final "wikilink"), partnering with
[Winter](User:winter "wikilink"). I've written some
[proposals](Proposals "wikilink") for the game mechanics, and I also
maintain the project's official IRC channel (#ufo:ai on
irc.freenode.net).

My real name is Bas Fournier.
