You should actually implement this one, to flesh out the EM Technology
Tree. It would include a pistol, a rifle (this one is already in there),
and a Heavy Version (possibly this coilgun). Craft and base weapons
could be considered also. This could also solve the ranged stun weapon
problem (propel a electrically charged object using a modified EM
weapon, or a brand new one). I hope you devs like this idea! [Muton

## Maybe I did not understood Well

- In shape it's a fairly standard fin-stabilised penetrator inside a
  discarding sabot
- Unlike even our Bolter, nothing comes out the barrel except the bullet

Those two lines are not in contradiction ? Is not a Sabot a device that
is thrown out when firing ?
