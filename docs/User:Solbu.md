## About

- Johnny A. Solbu
- Trondheim, Norway
- I sometimes play Minesweeper when I'm bored.
- Currently [translating](Available_translations "wikilink") UFO:AI into
  Norwegian.

## Other projects

- Sometime during the summer of 1996 I translated much of the first
  Civilization into \[ norwegian\] during a weekend, because I was
  bored. It was never meant to be released, so I replaced the intro
  text, which is the theory of evolution, with the biblical Creation
  story from Genesis 1. Mostly because I reject the Evolution theory and
  believe in Christ. (It was for my own enjoyment, so who cared? :-)= )
- Sometime around 2002 I translated the Windows program \[ Create
  Install\] into norwegian.
- In january 2012 I translated \[ GRASE\] into norwegian, in a day.
  continuing translating UFO:AI is next. :-)=
- In July 2012 I joined the \[ Translation Project\].
- I have created a few Mandriva/Mageia \[ SPEC files\] and various RPM
  packages. In january 2012 I became an official Mandriva packager, and
  became a Mageia packager in June 2012. \o/
