Hmmm, maby this bulding may provide rest and enertainement for peoples,
boosting thiers performance and increasing morale (recovery) ?


The morale revocery speed increase is a great idea. I'd propose also
Command Centre in the same role, but it should be cumulative. Here are
also some ideas that got wiped out:

Perhaps Team Room is needed for the workers, medics, etc. to act as
militia? (Soldiers have their own team assignment and training so they
don't need one.) The menu that opens at base defence, in which you
choose 8 of the scientists, soldiers, workers and medics for defece, can
also be called Team Room. If no Team Room, the 8 first hired soldiers in
base are automatically chosen. --[Bandobras](User:Bandobras "wikilink")

This is where the soldiers and other persons spend their free time in
the base, playing billard, table-tennis and watching TV. So the teamroom
is important for holding up the morale. If the base gets attacked, this
is a cheap room to put between the entrance and more important rooms,
such as the [Power Plant](Power_Plant "wikilink").
