These rounds don't work like other shotgun shells. Instead of firing a
projectile, these eject a cone of gas that lingers for a while, which is
useful in riot scenarios. Varying effects on those who end up in the
cloud depending on gas used.

Types of gas shells Tear gas/sleepy gas: reduce TUs and/or render victim
unconscious

Poison gas: reduces health(obviously)

Dragon breath: this one doesn't act like the rest. It ejects flammable
gas that ignites immediately(due to heat from shot) and causes immediate
fire damage.
