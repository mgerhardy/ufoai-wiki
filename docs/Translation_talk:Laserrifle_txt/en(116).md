The TU cost for the secondary fire (22) seems a bit prohibitive to me;
even the fastest team members only have 9 TUs of movement before firing
if they want to use it, and even then the alien would likely have had to
end it's turn in the line of fire. And that's assuming the soldier won't
need to move into cover after firing. --[MNONE](User:MNONE "wikilink")
