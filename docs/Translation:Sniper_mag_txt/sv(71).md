### Overview

This magazine contains 5 rounds of 20x140mm HMG (Heavy Machine Gun)
ammunition. It is a conventional single-column box design, and can be
extremely heavy due to the weight of the rounds inside. One magazine can
weigh up to 1 kilogramme depending on the type of ammo used. The rounds
in this magazine are high-quality match grade ammunition meant for heavy
sniper rifles; they are more accurate and expensive than ordinary HMG
rounds.

The magazine is meant to be loaded into an S-1 Sniper Rifle.

### Recommended Doctrine

All soldiers equipped with sniper rifles should carry at least one
reload whenever they go out in the field. It is not advisable to send
our troops into combat without spare magazines.
