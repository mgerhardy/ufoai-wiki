The first attack hits the city of Mumbai on the 3rd of March, 2084. Six
small UFOs appear out of nowhere and come screaming down from orbit,
undetected by the vast radar installations covering the skies over
Mumbai, and set down in the single most densely-populated city on Earth.
They offer no warning, no explanation. Twenty thousand innocent
civilians and three battalions of elite troops are massacred over the
course of twelve brutal hours before massed Commonwealth soldiers manage
to bring the aliens' advance to a standstill. Then, as suddenly as they
appeared, they retreat to their craft and vanish back into orbit,
leaving only the ravaged streets of Mumbai as evidence.
