Hi there,

this article is about a truth serum for improved interrogation. However,
the German title for this research proposal was "The Anti-Serum", thus
an anti-serum/drug/agent which disables the XVI-Infection in the human
(and alien?) body.

So, whereÂ´s the mistake? Did the author of the english wiki-contribution
misunderstand the topic or did some guy translate the title improperly
into german?

thanks in advance!

(sorry if I insulted somebody...)
