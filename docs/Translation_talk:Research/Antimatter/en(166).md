In the tech proposal for antimatter, you write that antimatter has
"...the best **size-to-weight** ratio of any material ...". Isn't that a
bit meaningless? Maybe it should be "...the best **energy-to-mass**
ratio of any material ...", like you say in the [Antimatter
Weaponry](Research/Antimatter_Weaponry "wikilink") tech description?
