## General

This needs a cutscene and a special scripted mission: Ideally the tech
Orbital UFO Activity would start a timer, then give the player an e-mail
giving him the choice of shooting down the Carrier when he's ready.

## Cutscene

The cutscene comes before the mission. It should be either an animation
of a space gun, as described in Orbital UFO Activity, shooting down a
Carrier UFO, or just a still image of a Carrier in orbit being hit by a
large artillery shell.

## Mission

![](Maplayout.jpg "Maplayout.jpg") The mission should be in two parts:

- The objective in the first part is to gain entry to the crashed
  Carrier. This should focus on the outskirts of the crash site, rather
  than the Carrier's whole bulk, since it would be far too large to fit
  on one of our maps. One side of the Carrier should occupy one edge of
  the map, thus giving the player a point where he can enter the UFO,
  but maintaining a sense of scale. The player would have to fight
  through entrenched aliens to get to the entrance.
- The second part is securing the interior of the Carrier, with the
  alien FTL drive in it. A possible additional objective would be to
  keep the aliens from permanently damaging or destroying the FTL drive.

## FTL drive

The FTL (faster than light) device should be big; three or four levels
high at least. Also see this talk page's article and [The Alien
Strategy](Research/The_Alien_Strategy "wikilink") for more information
about it.

The FTL device should be roughly spherical in shape, with two toroids
(rings) encircling it, and should hover freely in the air. It doesn't
necessarily have to look like other alien technology. A slightly crude
appearance would be ideal.
