This is a more difficult version of the Standard Campaign. You will
receive fewer soldiers, engineers and scientists, nations will be more
difficult to please, research will be slower and more demanding, and the
aliens will be tougher.

This option represents the Hard difficulty level, and is recommended for
expert players.
