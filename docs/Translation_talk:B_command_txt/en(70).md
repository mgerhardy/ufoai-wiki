This does not agree with my current vision, please see the scripts. What
do you think? --[Bandobras](User:Bandobras "wikilink") 00:52, 10 August

Another proposal, perhaps let it affect, just as is the case for Team
Room, the speed of morale recovery after missions.

An additional proposal. Have it give that moral recovery increase, but
also it could allow for more favorable set ups (Maybe customize your
setup) for the start of base defenses. Also, since it would help with
intel, could lower the chances of a disadvantagous start of a mission:
Less likely to be ambushed as you are just walking off the drop ship.
