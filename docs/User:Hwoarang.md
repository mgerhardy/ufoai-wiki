Hi, I'm Flávio Henrique and I live in Goiânia-GO, Brazil.

I'm a Java Developer and graduated in Network Computers.

I love X-Com based games and I will invest a piece of my time to this
project, because I like open-source projects.

I'm also translator in two other open-projects: Psi (www.psi-im.org) and
eGroupWare (www.egroupware.org)

Cya
